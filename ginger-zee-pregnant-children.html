While in Teen Mom 2, she began dating her current husband, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/cole-deboer/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole DeBoer</a>, in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, they are married and have been the best parents to Aubree, Watson, Layne, and Walker DeBoer. They even have their own HGTV show, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/down-home-fab/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Down Home Fab</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Here is all we know about the duo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chelsea DeBoer and her husband Cole DeBoer</h2><p>Chelsea first saw her husband at a gas station in 2014 and it was love at first sight for her. She recalled to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">US Weekly</a>;</p><p>“He was across at the other pump. And I looked, and he was staring at me. We didn’t even talk. We just kept looking at each other because we’re both shy. And then we were passing each other when we left because we lived out towards the same way.”</p><p>Since their first encounter, Chelsea knew that Cole was the one for her. She went home to her friend and said, “I just saw the guy I’m going to marry at the gas station, but we didn’t talk.’”</p><p>Thankfully, Cole contacted her on social media. She said, “And a few days later, he contacted me on social media and was like, ‘Hi. I got gas next to you the other day.’ And I was like, ‘Thank you, Jesus.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Chelsea was a single mother to Aubree, whom she shared with ex-boyfriend Adam Lind, before meeting Cole. While the reality TV star frequently returned to her boyfriend, she ended things with Adam for real after falling for Cole.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, Cole moved in with Chelsea and Aubree. In November 2015, Cole proposed to Chelsea but only after asking Aubree for permission.</p><p>Thankfully, Aubree was excited for Cole and Chelsea to get married and soon, the duo got engaged. In October 2016, the duo tied the knot in an intimate ceremony.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The duo have been together since then and there has been no Chelsea and Cole cheating scandal. Their <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/hgtv/ rel="noreferrer noopener">HGTV</a> show and social media also show that Chelsea leads a very happy life with her husband and children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chelsea DeBoer’s children</h2><p>Chelsea and her partner at the time, Lind, had their first child, Aubree, in 2009. Chelsea’s relationship with Lind was tumultuous from the start, and Teen Mom 2 fans saw young Chelsea struggle to find her feet as a single mom.</p><p>However, after parting from Lind, Chelsea found her happily ever after with her current husband, Cole. She shares three <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">children</a> with her present husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Chelsea-DeBoer.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Chelsea DeBoer, her husband Cole DeBoer, and their four children. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Chelsea was pregnant with her second child, Cole’s first child, when the duo got married. They welcomed Watson on January 25, 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>They welcomed their daughter, Layne, on August 29, 2018. Their daughter, Walker, was born on the same day as Watson, but four years apart.</p><p>Walker was born on January 25, 2021. Despite not being Aubree’s biological father, Cole considered herself as her dad like he is for his other children.</p><p>Cole has remained a constant in his stepdaughter’s life, despite Aubree’s biological father’s drug addiction and repeated incarceration. During an Instagram Q&A in November 2018, he even stated that if given the opportunity, he would “100%” adopt Aubree.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>When asked if taking on the position of stepfather was tough for him, Cole said, “Not at all,” before providing advice to individuals in a similar circumstance.&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t force the bond. Make/enjoy moments. Be there. Support. Show you care and are reliable. That’s Love,” he said.</p><p>Because neither Chelsea nor Cole has provided an update on Adam and his parental rights, however, it appears that Cole has yet to formally adopt Aubree.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chelsea and Cole Lawsuit</h2><p>Chelsea and Cole have an ongoing lawsuit. Chelsea and her husband, Cole, were sued for $3 million by consulting firm Envy in 2020 for allegedly withholding money from social media promotions.</p><p>Envy filed an Amended Complaint in the same complaint, adding Chelsea and Cole’s firms Down Home DeBoer, Aubree Says, Dakota Ln LLC, and DeBoer Holding Company as defendants. The ex-business partner is now claiming for $4 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cole and Chelsea filed a countersuit, rejecting the charges. They also claim that Envy withheld $155,000 in revenues from them.</p><p>Envy had originally requested $3 million from the couple, but they increased it to $4 million in 2020. Many of the couple’s other businesses are now named in the case, including Down Home DeBoer, Aubree Says, Dakota Ln LLC, and DeBoer Holding Company.</p><p>Envy has been with Chelsea since 2015, while Cole joined them in 2016. Both parties have just recently concluded discovery, when they supplied all evidence and witness statements, over three years later. Because neither Envy nor the DeBoers consented to a settlement, the dispute will be heard in court.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Chelsea claimed Envy has “actually harmed the professional careers of Defendants Chelsea and Cole by withholding considerable payments from them and acting in an unprofessional manner, including but not limited to, arguing with and acting disrespectfully toward Chelsea and Cole, potential and then-existing licensing contacts, and other professional contacts of Chelsea and Cole.”</p><p>They also claimed that Envy intentionally omitted numerous deals and/or revenues from the Account Statements for the sole purpose of depriving the defendants of receiving funds rightfully due and owing to them.</p><p>Chelsea claimed they owed her $154,074.62 from business transactions. In their reaction, Envy disputed the allegations made against them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Envy also wants a third of Chelsea and Cole’s earnings from Viacom, the media firm that owns MTV.</p><p>According to the court documents, Envy worked on both the initial Viacom deal as well as changes and extensions to it during the duration of the DeBoer Agreements. If appropriate, emails demonstrating Envy’s role in creating and modifying the relevant agreements, as well as supporting Chelsea and Cole in complying with them, would be used to demonstrate this fact.</p><p>According to the court documents, they are entitled to “35 percent of millions of dollars of revenue from the Viacom Agreements,” which is the same figure they agreed with for social media revenue. Chelsea and Cole filed a motion to reject the request.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of writing, there have been no updates on the lawsuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57069knJ2cmq%2BztdOyZqChnpyys3nZnpxmqKKatK%2Btza1knKCZobGzsc1o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jai-courtney-married-wife-girlfriend-career.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Jai Courtney Married To Wife After Split With Mecki Dent?</a>
