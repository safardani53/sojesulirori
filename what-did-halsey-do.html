In April of 2018, the singer caused a stir when she tweeted about not wanting to use "<a href=#>white people shampoo</a>," leading her to defend her comments and discuss her biracial background.&nbsp;</p><p>When #HalseyIsOverParty began trending on Twitter, fans were wondering why people wanted the singer to be canceled. Some said it was because of Halsey's tweet about kissing fans way back in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What did Halsey do?</a> Details on the old tweet that is resurfacing and what exactly happened.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Halsey do? Halsey Is Over Party is trending.</h2><p>Like it or not, cancel culture is a trend among social media users to demonstrate when they're not happy with the antics or beliefs of a celebrity. Halsey's past Twitter behavior has been called into question before, as some of her pre-fame tweets haven't exactly aged well.</p><p>Many people began tweeting about canceling Halsey, but Twitter users couldn't exactly agree on why they were doing so.</p><p>In 2014, Halsey tweeted, "I keep promising underage fans that I'm gonna make out with them. I am SO going to jail." In the years since she first put this tweet out, Halsey has deleted it.</p><p>Halsey allegedly used to kiss fans at her concerts to help them come out, or to be their first kisses. Though she's since stopped doing this, fans are now calling it out.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, a video of her kissing a fan at a concert was released, and people began saying that the girl Halsey kissed was underage at the time. Others said this was definitely not the first or only time that Halsey had done this at a concert, and that her tweet was proof of this. She apparently stopped kissing fans at meet-and-greets and at her concerts because she suffers from an autoimmune disease.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Some fans came to the singer's defense, saying that it was all harmless, and that she only kissed fans who wanted to be kissed. Others said that the incidents occurred years ago, and that it wasn't fair to be shaming her now.</p><p>Several Twitter users also noted that Halsey has done a lot for the LGBTQ+ community since she became famous (Halsey is openly bisexual) and that she shouldn't be judged for her behavior so many years earlier. &nbsp;</p><p>The singer has yet to speak out on her now-deleted tweet. But, considering that she did delete it in the past, she likely has realized how problematic it is in today's climate.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing Halsey has recently commented on is her change in relationship status.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Halsey just confirmed that she's dating Evan Peters.</h2><p>While appearing on Ellen, Halsey finally confirmed that she is dating American Horror Story alum Evan Peters. During the pre-Halloween show, Ellen tried to scare the singer by having a member of her staff jump out during their interview.&nbsp;</p><p>"You distracted me with the boyfriend question, I wasn't ready," Halsey said. "I don't know what's scarier, having to talk about my boyfriend on TV or having that happen!"</p><p>Ellen had brought up Halsey and Evan's couple costume for the AHS 100th episode party. The pair dressed as Sonny and Cher, but Halsey only began referring to Evan as her boyfriend on Ellen.</p><p>Prior to going public with Evan, Halsey was linked to singer Yungblud. She confirmed their split several days before the Ellen interview, saying that the two simply broke up, and that there was no cheating or drama involved in the end of their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lmJa5tLHYZpuo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tiny-ti-helping-king-music-career-rap-interview.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tiny &amp;amp; T.I.
