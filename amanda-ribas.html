Early life and Family</h2><p><strong>Amanda Limborco Alcantara Ribas</strong> shortly, Amanda Ribas was born on August 26, 1993. She grew up with her father and brother in Varginha, Minas Gerais.</p><p>However, there is no detailed information about her mother. Amanda was born to a jiu-jitsu master, <strong>Marcelo Ribas</strong>; hence, she started her combat sports training at a young age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Amanda-Ribas-with-her-brother-234x300.png><p>Her father taught her both Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Judo. As she trained under her father alongside her brother, <strong>Arthur Ribas</strong>, she faced some injuries along the way.</p><p>Those intense injuries kept her away from the mat for a long time, making her rethink her path in combative sports.</p><p>That very moment, her knee surgeries made her discouraged, wanting to get back in the fight for the octagon. However, through the setback, she found a way to keep herself moving.</p><p>“I was born on the mat. It was for me. There was a time when I stopped doing jiu-jitsu to dance. My father wanted to die, but now: gloves were my pillows and my kimono, my blanket.”<br>-Amanda Ribas QUOTES</p><h2>How old is Amanda Ribas?

As for her looks, Ribas has an oval-shaped face with small features.</p><p>She has flowing medium-dark brown hair with eyes of the same color. In the meantime, she wears a shoe with the size number 6.5 (US) and has a reach of 66 inches.</p><h2>Amanda Ribas | Mixed Martial Arts Career</h2><p>With years of hardcore training and cancellation of fights, Amanda first started officially at the age of 20. Back in the time, she partook in the 2014&nbsp;IMMAF World Championship held in July.</p><p>Therefore, Ribas publicly came into the light as a fighter in the Women’s Flyweight division in Brazil. By the end of the time, she had recorded a 6-1 score in the interval of three years.</p><p>She successfully turned from an amateur to well-built with just those three years into professional Mixed Martial Arts.</p><p>Additionally, as Amanda took victory in six games out of seven, she was suggested to go on for the United States training and games.</p><p>Keeping it in mind, she went on to train under Carlão Barreto and Rodrigo “Minotauro” Nogueira (former fighters and friend of American Top Team head coach “Conan” Silveira).</p><p>In the meantime, she teamed and trained under them while alongside <a href=#><strong>Amanda Nunes</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Joanna Jedrzejczyk</strong></a>.</p><h3>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)</h3><p>When one’s dream comes true, we shed tears of joy and leap on happiness. The same goes for Amanda; with a series of games canceled, she was finally called up to start in the big leagues.</p><p>Amanda Ribas stated while recalling that day,</p><p>“Then I cried, right? Because it is the beginning of the realization of a dream. I called my father. I told him, and everyone stopped at the gym, and they cried too. As you know, I came from a small town, and for me, it is overcoming. There in the south of Minas, we think this is not even possible. Getting signed with the UFC is an example for everyone there that it is possible.”</p><p>Right then, Ribas had her debut match with&nbsp;<a href=#>Juliana Lima</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;The Ultimate Fighter 25 Finale on July 7, 2017; however, USADA removed her from the match.</p><p>As per her reports, her removal from the game stems from the fact that she had Ostarine (Enobosarm, an androgen) found in her body.</p><p>Hence, <strong>Tecia Torres</strong> replaced Ribas for the game while USADA gave Ribas a two-year suspension from UFC, but it was terminated later on May 3, 2019.</p><h4>Amanda Ribas vs. Emily Whitmire</h4><p>On June 29, 2019, Amanda Ribas had her debut game against <a href=# rel=noopener>Emily Whitmire</a> after removing her suspension&nbsp;at&nbsp;UFC on ESPN 3.</p><p>During the match, Ribas faced a two-fight-winning strike player who had defeated <strong>Jamie Moyle</strong> and <strong>Aleksandra Albu</strong> with <span><strong>Vance Swerdan</strong> as the referee</span>.</p><p>With Emily leading her, Ribas claimed the game early in the second round. Thus, Ribas had a win via a rear-naked choke submission.</p><p>“I was not in the cage that day. Amanda is super talented, and I think she will be champion at some point, but I didn’t fight well.”<br>–<a href=# rel=noopener>Emily Whitmire</a></p><h4>Amanda Ribas vs. <a href=#>Mackenzie Dern</a></h4><p>After her debut, Ribas advanced to UFC Fight Night: Joanna vs. Waterson in October of the same year. Going into the fight, no one talked about her, and she was facing a top prospect of UFC, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mackenzie Dern</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Ribas provided a fight to see as she had a combination of strikes with lightning speed. By the end of the round, she had overtaken the judges impressively to earn a score of 30-27.</p><p>During the match, Ribas showcased her stiff straight shots, and jabs while not sparing even a second to react for Dern.</p><p>Until the end, Ribas avoided all the punches from Dern and won the fight by unanimous decision of the judges. Herewith, Ribas gave dern the very first taste of the UFC loss.</p><p>&nbsp;“Amanda is a bit longer than me, and when I lost the distance, I started doubting myself, doubting my decision to close the distance and get punched in the face. After you have your first loss, it only makes you hungrier to get back in there.”<br>–<a href=#>Mackenzie Dern</a></p><h4>Amanda Ribas vs. Randa Markos</h4><p>With two official wins and a fight in the UFC, Ribas was set to face <strong>Paige Vanzant</strong> on March 14, 2020.</p><p>However, Vanzant had an injury in the right arm, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Randa Markos</a> replaced her. The very match took in her homeland, Brazil.</p><p>As the fight commenced, Markos was starting aggressive and even had a takedown. However, Amanda was given a series of back fists and kicked with a heavy strike.</p><p>Overall, with the judges on her side, Ribas won the game with a unanimous decision as they had scores of &nbsp;30-26, 30-25, and 30-25 for the three rounds.</p><p>You can find the latest fight details and records relating to Amanda on the <a href=#><strong>Tapology website</strong>.</a></p><h4>Amanda Ribas vs. Paige Vanzant</h4><p>Advancing further, Amanda finally faced <strong>Paige Vanzant</strong> at&nbsp;<strong>UFC 251</strong> on July 12, 2020. Up to that, Ribas had garnered a ton of followers eagerly waiting for her to serve her ninth game in the UFC clash.</p><p>All in all, the match was a short interval, which ended in just 141 seconds. Ribas had a landed knee, “<strong>12 gauge</strong>” down, followed by an attempted submission during the fight.</p><p>As it stretched, Ribas later managed to pass a brapper armbar, thus, dominating the octagon. In the end, Amanda won the fight easily as Vanzant tapped out in the first round.</p><p>“Congrats to Amanda on such an amazing performance. It was truly an honor to share the octagon with you. As for me, I will rise as I always do. I can’t wait to see where God takes me next.”<br>-Paige Vanzant</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amanda-Ribas-vs.-Paige.jpg><h4>Amanda Ribas | Upcoming Fights</h4><p>According to the sources, Amanda Ribas was to face <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carla Esparza</a> officially on December 12’s match; however, the news has been pulled off.</p><p>To illustrate, the match was set to make Carla return to<strong> UFC Women’s Strawweight Champion.</strong></p><p>As of now, the verbal agreement has been pulled down, and it is believed they might fight some other date in the upcoming year.</p><p>Thus, to close off the match, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Waterson</a> has been scheduled to face Ribas in 2021.</p><p>In the bargain, UFC president Dana White has confirmed the match to be at the top of the UFC 257 pay-per-view event, but they haven’t confirmed the location yet.</p><p>To look little into Waterson, she is one of the strawweight division’s top prospects, with a 6-4 record in the UFC.
