Jean decided to travel to Germany to learn the language, return home, and teach the same.</p><p>However, while he was in Germany, he fell in love with Birgit, and Jean’s stay became permanent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Serge-Gnabry-In-His-Early-Years-As-A-Stuttgart-Academy-Player-Source-Pinterest.jpg><p>With Serge’s birth, Hermann devoted his life to guiding his son toward his goals by becoming his advisor. Initially, Gnabry had no passion for football whatsoever.</p><p>The Stuttgart native, as a child, watched his idol, <a href=# rel=noopener>Usain Bolt</a><strong>,</strong> who is a retired Jamaican sprinter.</p><p>As a result, he was more into track and field, and football was secondary.</p><p>On the other hand, as Usain set records upon records, Serge felt it would be difficult to catch up to his idol, thereby abandoning his plans to be a sprinter one day.</p><p>Eventually, the German found his calling for football.</p><p>Without a moment of delay, the young aspirant joined his local team, TSV Weissach. Although the local team was only a harboring ground, it opened up passages to other bigger clubs.</p><h2>Serge Gnabry | Age, Height, & Physical Stats | How Old Is Gnabry?</h2><p>Born in 1995 makes the winger 28 -years old as of now. Young, versatile, and full of energy, there is not much Serge has to inculcate; he only would be to rack up his goalscoring as things stand.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, Gnabry’s insatiable hunger to prove is unparalleled. Indeed, he is no <a href=# rel=noopener>Lionel Messi</a> or <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> of his time, but nobody can overlook that this German is bound for global overtaking.</p><p>Besides, standing at the height of 1.75 m and weighing almost 165 lbs, the Bayern winger is as quick as mercury.</p><p>Serge is very conscious of his health and diet plans. In one of the interviews, he spoke about his food and diet plans:</p><p>I have been vegan since January 2019, but, at some periods, sometimes I eat meat&nbsp;and other things</p><p>Due to his blazing burst of pace and dribbling ability, Gnabry’s teammates dubbed him Turbo Speed.</p><p>When it comes to speed, he has fierce competition with fellow Bayern teammates, Kingsley Coman and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Alphonso Davies</a>,</strong> and even German national teammate <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Timo Werner</strong></a> but it is unsurprising that Ivorian-German can give anyone a run for their money.</p><p>Despite his size compared to taller opponents, the strength he possesses during duels or a perfect tackle evasion technique is simply unmatched.</p><p>Of course, pace, agility, and dribbling are his forte but make no mistake; Serge is an expert marksman.</p><p>Furthermore, his cheeky ball control techniques, exceptional passing ability, and, most importantly, an unselfish attitude gained him much-deserved praise from his teammates and coaches.</p><p>On top of that, the winger can play any position, left, right, or as a striker; simply icing on the cake, isn’t it?</p><p><strong>Click Here <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Lewandowski Bio: Age, Height, Stats, Club, Career, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>Serge Gnabry | Career: Club & Country | How Many Goals Has Gnabry Scored This Season?</h2><p>Starting with local clubs from smaller divisions to Arsenal’s snatched from Stuttgart, Gnabry’s future looked bright as a sunny day.</p><p>Having looked up to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Mesut Ozil</strong> </a>since his childhood, it was a matter of time before he got to play with him at Arsenal.</p><p>Firstly, he played with the U-18 squad upon joining and was promoted to the reserves after the manager saw promising talents in the young boy.</p><p>Immediately in the 2012/13 season, the German winger debuted for Arsenal in a preseason game against FC Koln.</p><p>Likewise, in a League Cup game against Coventry City, Serge donned the Gunner jersey in a competitive match, replacing Oxlade-Chamberlain on September 26, 2012.</p><p>Again, he started in a defeat against Norwich City&nbsp;in his first-ever Premier League game.</p><p>Despite the loss, it was a proud moment for Gnabry, and he also became the youngest-ever debutante, 17 years and 98 days, second only to<strong> Jack Wilshere.</strong></p><p>In like manner, he made his Champions League debut against his home country club Schalke 04 in a 2-0 loss.</p><p>Furthermore, with Arsenal, a lot needed to be achieved for the budding star. In a competition called the NextGen Series, Serge netted the only goal to seal the victory against CSKA Moscow U19s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Serge-Gnabry-with-Arsenals-the-manager-Arsene-Wenger-Source-sports.com_.jpg><p>In the same way, a goal against Chelsea U19s and Liverpool U21s was added to his scoresheet.</p><p>Moving on, in the 2013/14 season, the German forward sent out waves through the Premier League with a praiseworthy start to a new season.</p><p>Eventually, he received a nomination for Golden&nbsp;Boy Award and a new five-year deal with Arsenal.</p><p>However, success stories are not devoid of failures, as an injury-plagued 2014/15 season saw him relegated to the bench and, in August 2015, a move to West Bromwich.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yann Sommer Bio: Wife, Height, Clubs, Stats, Net Worth, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></p><h3>Back To Bundesliga</h3><p>After a failed experience with the Baggies, it was time for Gnabry to return to Arsenal.</p><p>Again, there was nothing left for him at Arsenal either, so Bundesliga side Werder Bremen signed him in the July transfer window of 2016.</p><p>Nevertheless, it comes without a doubt that the then-manager of Arsenal, Arsene Wenger was incredibly fond of the young German.</p><p>Even today, Serge is grateful for the experiences he had under the legendary manager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/serge-1267.jpg><p data-wp-editing=1>Serge Gnabry as Werder Bremen player</p><p>Next, Germany was the country where he would genuinely get a chance to shine.</p><p>Werder Bremen, Gnabry opened his scoresheet with a goal against Borussia Monchengladbach and went on to tally 11 goals in 27 league appearances with the Bundesliga club.</p><p>Like many things, a superb performance seldom fails to catch the eye, and in this case, Bayern Munich was monitoring the young winger’s development.</p><p>In other words, he would represent the record champions on June 11, 2017.</p><p>While this may be true, Gnabry knew to make it at Bayern, he would need enough playtime, and for this reason, he asked the board for a loan move.</p><p>Three days later, the winger traveled to Hoffenheim on a season-long loan.</p><p>One of the biggest memories etched in Bundesliga’s fans was his long-range screamer against RB Leipzig that ended in a 4-0 victory.</p><p>Similarly, Serge’s efforts landed Hoffenheim a Champions League spot in the upcoming season.</p><h3>Becoming A Bavarian</h3><p>Now, it was time for the German international to cement his place with the Bavarian club. Since the legendary Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben were departing at the end of the 2018/19 season, all faith rested upon Serge and his winger partner Kingsley Coman.</p><p data-wp-editing=1>On September 1, 2018, the Ivorian-German forward made an official debut for the Bundesliga giants to victory over VfB Stuttgart.</p><p>After scoring his first goal against SC Freiburg, Gnabry would register ten goals in 30 league appearances.</p><p>Once upon a time, <strong>Tony Pulis,</strong> West Brom’s manager, stated,</p><p>Serge has come here to play games but he just hasn’t been for me, at the moment, at that level to play the games.”</p><p>Four years later, he would receive a huge slap in the face when Gnabry shot past Tottenham in a Champions League game, a total of four times.</p><p>Oh, how the tables turned, and maybe Pulis regrets his statements or even lets Gnabry go.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was only the start of what the skillful winger would demonstrate in the 2019/20 campaign.</p><p>In a 7-2 thrashing of Premier League club, Tottenham Hotspurs, Serge scored a poker, rightfully earning MOTM in the CL group stage game.</p><p>Sometime later, in the Champions League’s knockout stage, the Bayern winger scored a brace in a 3-0 defeat of Chelsea.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UCL games have been indefinitely postponed, and hence the second-leg games were not played.</p><h2>Serge Gnabry | Quotes</h2><p>“I never dreamed Id score four goals, the pressure helped. My father told me I had to play well.”</p><p>Serge followed his previous year’s record for record by scoring 10+ goals in a single Bundesliga season for 4th time in a row.</p><p>As the Bundesliga commentators exclaim, “Specialist in dream goals and defender’s worst nightmare,” is seemingly real as things stand.</p><p>Right after the pandemic was a bit controlled, for the 2020-21 season, Serge acquired the No 7 shirt which was worn by Franck Ribery.</p><p>In the first match of the season, he scored a hat-trick with a score of 8-0 against Schalke.</p><p><strong>Click To Know About This Player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuel Neuer Bio: Age, Career, Stats, Net Worth, Wife, Instagram Wiki ></a></strong></p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Notwithstanding his club successes, the uberly talented winger represented his birth country on the international stage, primarily in the youth levels like the U-16s, U-17s, and U-18s.</p><p>Afterward, with the U-21 squad, Gnabry celebrated the European U-21 Championship victory, which paved the way for his nomination in the 2016 Summer Olympics squad. Again, the winger didn’t fail to impress.</p><p>Gnabry scored a goal against Mexico in a 2-2 draw, two against South Korea for the equalizer, and another 2 in a 10-0 battering of Fiji.</p><p>Likewise, a single goal against Portugal helped Germany advance to the semi-finals and, in the end, clinched the silver medal.</p><p>Yet, the main chapter of his life had to be unearthed.</p><p>After receiving a call-up to the senior team, Serge secured his place in the starting lineup after scoring a hat-trick against San Marino in the 2018 World Cup Qualifier.</p><p>In the end, things didn’t look good for Germany, as the Bayern winger sustained an injury, and the national side would go crashing out of the tournament in the group stage.</p><p>All hope is not lost for Germany as the entire roster got revitalized with additions of young and vibrant players like <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Leroy Sane</a></strong>, Serge Gnabry,<strong><a href=# rel=noopener> Timo Werner</a></strong>, Niklas Sule, etc.</p><p>Further, Serge, in 2019, broke Miroslav Klose’s record of scoring ten goals in 13 matches to the former’s 11 games. The Bayern forward is tied with Gerd Muller’s record of 13 goals in 13 matches.</p><p><strong>Click Know More About Particular PLayer Mentioned Below <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander
