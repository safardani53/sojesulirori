have debated whether it will be someone from <a href=#>Gerry Turner</a>'s season of <a href=#>The Golden Bachelor</a> or someone new.</p><p>Now, <a href=#>Hannah Ann Sluss</a>, the winner of <a href=#>Peter Weber</a>'s season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, is sharing her pick after tuning in to watch Gerry's journey, which ended in an engagement to <a href=#>Theresa Nist</a>.</p><p>She told The U.S. Sun: "I would love it to be Leslie, just because I know her and I'm rooting for her love story."</p><p><a href=#>Leslie Fhima</a>, 64, became the runner-up after Gerry, 72, dumped her during an&nbsp;<a href=#>emotional conversation</a>&nbsp;that took place in&nbsp;<a href=#>Costa Rica</a> for the <a href=#>three-hour live finale</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Golden Bachelor">Read More on Golden Bachelor</h2><p>Hannah, 27, went on to say that sometimes producers "throw you for a loop and they won't use someone on the past season."</p><p>She explained: "I know in the past with The Bachelor, they brought out some other people or one of the bachelors who no one knew, no one was invested... or haven't seen their heartbreak."</p><p><a href=#>Matt James</a>, the Season 25 Bachelor, was not part of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> prior to becoming the show's lead.</p><p>Despite not knowing who producers will pick, Hannah believes the "best move" would be picking the runner-up Leslie because fans are "already invested into her storyline."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>TEAM THERESA</h2><p>After hearing her friends boast about The Golden Bachelor, the home decor expert caved in and started watching the <a href=#>senior ladies</a> get a second chance at love with the retired restaurateur.</p><p>"The drama is definitely different because just they're in a different phase of life, but for me, the dating and the love aspect of it came across very genuine and sincere," Hannah shared.</p><p>"And it kind of gave you a newfound hope that these couples could actually last."</p><p>While she couldn't tell who Gerry was going to pick in the end due to the producers' expected plot twist, she's rooting for Gerry and Theresa to last, especially long after their wedding.</p><p>The engaged couple will <a href=#>tie the knot on January 4</a> in <a href=#>California</a> for the entire country to watch on <a href=#>TV</a>.</p><p>Despite not making it last with Peter (he broke up with her to get back with contestant <a href=#>Madison Prewett</a>), Hannah is hopeful that Gerry and Theresa will live the rest of their lives together.</p><p>The social media <a href=#>influencer</a>, who is now engaged to <a href=#>NFL</a> player <a href=#>Jake Funk</a>, said that the best advice she could give is to "take it day by day."</p><p>She elaborated: "For me, I can honestly say there's nothing I would've done differently. I was honest and genuine the entire time.</p><p>"And so, if you have found someone that is that, then you're able just to transition into life seamlessly because on the show you are in a different world almost.</p><p>"So going back into your life, your hobbies, your passions, you're able to really get to know a whole new level of someone, which I feel like will just be a really easy transition for them."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>WEDDING PLANNING</h2><p>After getting engaged to the <a href=#>Miami Dolphins</a> running back in January, Hannah is in the middle of <a href=#>wedding</a> planning.</p><p>The destination wedding will take place in 2024.</p><p>She told The U.S. Sun that she's enjoyed planning so far.</p><p>"One of the things I've just tried to put at the forefront of my mind is just really keep things very simple and something that's manageable, because with the football season, there's always constant changes going on," she shared, while adding, "I really just wanted to not feel stressed or overwhelmed and truly be able to enjoy it."</p><p>Jake, for his part, is just as involved in planning "until he figures out the price of things, and then it's a different conversation," she joked.</p><p>"It's just been so much fun to take on that process together - from the flowers to invitations. He's been really enjoying it, which is something that really surprised me."</p><p>She couldn't tease too many details of her wedding, but she did say that she and Jake are getting married in a "different way."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>WHAT'S TO COME</h2><p>As anyone who is dating someone in the NFL - just like <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> dating <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> - there are some challenges.</p><p>Hannah shared: "Planning and scheduling in the NFL is pretty much completely out the window.</p><p>"I feel like one thing that we have really both have been on the journey with learning is just how these guys just get tossed around.</p><p>"But it's the nature of it, and it's been really cool because we're able to go to different cities that I would've never had thought I would like or have been to."</p><p>In October, the couple moved from <a href=#>Indiana</a> to <a href=#>Florida</a> after Jake switched teams, from the <a href=#>Indianapolis Colts</a> to the Dolphins.</p><p>Hannah will be back in her hometown in <a href=#>Tennessee</a> for the holidays, and then, depending on the <a href=#>football</a> schedule, see her fiancé play in a game or two.</p><p>When she's not busy wedding planning, she's sharing recipes and other content on her <a href=#>social media</a> with her over million followers.</p><p>She teased: "I'm doing a bunch of food content and DIY right now.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"And then after that, going into January, possibly working on something really cool involving my wedding."</p><p>Looking forward to 2024, Hannah added: "I feel like there's going to be some really cool collaborations that will be full circle moments for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/thinks-producers-throw-fans-loop-867350956.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/abc-s-golden-bachelor-stars-856564277.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/nfl-player-jake-funk-engaged-791572940.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaG6GeHyYaJ%2Bapp6WtW6tzadkrKSlqMBuvNGem6KbpJ68r3nGqKOdnZ5ir6Kvx56jqKqVqcGmec%2Brpp2tk5q%2FtHnLqKapZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./conan-obrien-responds-to-reports-of-owed-back-taxes-on-home-2014236.html>&#171;&nbsp;Conan O'Brien Responds to Reports of Owed Back Taxes on Home</a>
