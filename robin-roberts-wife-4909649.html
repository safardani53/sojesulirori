I don‚Äôt know how we finally got the timing down, but that went on for quite a while‚Ä¶I do remember looking forward to that time in the morning when she would walk by and I could just go, I‚Äôd just run [to the window].‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-28>The couple also opened up about being there for each other during hardships ‚Äî including Robin‚Äôs breast cancer just two years into their relationship, and Amber losing her father.</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>‚ÄúWe had only been dating not even two years when I was diagnosed with breast cancer,‚Äù Robin explained ‚ÄúShe could have bailed early on in the relationship. No one would have blamed her‚Ä¶She‚Äôs so kind. She‚Äôs just really, really kind, and it‚Äôs so genuine, you know? It‚Äôs not trying to be anything other than who she is,‚Äù she&nbsp; said of her wife to be.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>‚ÄúIt can either tear you apart or bring you closer together, and thank the good Lord, it brought us closer together,‚Äù Robin went on. ‚ÄúWe are partners. We will do whatever it takes, and I think that the illnesses that we have gone through, and are going through, have only strengthened us and made us more compassionate with each other and have a better understanding of each other.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>The ABC host also revealed that they‚Äôve had their ups and downs ‚Äî revealing that their hardships sought them to seek couples counseling as they ‚Äúfought‚Äù to stay together. ‚ÄúThere was no piece of paper. There was no reason why we had to stay,‚Äù Robin confessed. ‚ÄúWe could have walked away at any time, and we didn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>During the interview, Robin and Amber revealed that they had a far from traditional proposal once they decided to tie the knot in 2022 following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>‚ÄúWe took the calamari rings and we slapped them on each other‚Äôs fingers and we just we proposed to one another,‚Äù Robin said. ‚ÄúNow looking back, it was pretty fitting for us to not have a down on one knee [proposal] and one person doing it and who was going to propose. It was just us hanging out in our little hole-in-the-wall Mexican spot and putting calamari rings on each other and saying, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go. Let‚Äôs do it.'‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-34>Amber also shared her feelings to Robin‚Äôs suggestion they make their union legal. ‚ÄúWhen she said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get married,‚Äô the feeling that I got was a rush of excitement, nervousness, of course ‚Ä¶ and happy,‚Äù she gushed. ‚ÄúWe had planned on getting married last year, but then I was diagnosed [with breast cancer] ‚Ä¶ so this was like perfect timing, saying it on air.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GomaKmXae8o7HRrapmr5mbsm6AmGlwb2xpZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./stephania-bell.html>&#171;&nbsp;Stephania Bell Biography</a>
