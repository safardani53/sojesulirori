They made money by advertising men with no clothes on.”</p><p>Ex-merchandiser Dr Kjerstin Gruys said: “The first week I worked at A&F the HR rep talked about how you could write Abercrombie & Fitch with dogs**t on a baseball cap and sell it for £40.</p><p>"She was like, ‘That’s where we are now, it’s awesome’.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch">Read more on Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch</h2><p>Although the shop reached peak cool at the turn of the millennium, it has been around since 1892, when it sold hunting and riding gear, hence the chain’s moose logo.</p><p>In 1988, the struggling retailer was bought by retail king Leslie Wexner, now 84, who already owned the lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret.</p><p>In the early Nineties, US owner L Brands hired Jeffries, now 77, to make the brand relevant again. The blond plastic-surgery fan remodelled it on the preppy fashion worn by rich white kids in America.</p><p>Electro music pumped out Shops were adorned with giant black-and-white posters of scantily clad, wholesome-looking white teens.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Entrances were flanked by two topless male models with six-packs.</p><p>Inside, electro music pumped out as teen shoppers and their confused parents explored the dimly lit aisles. Employees were drilled to represent brand guidelines set out by Jeffries.</p><p>Charles Martin, former design vice-president, said: “We built posters and we put ‘This is what Abercrombie is’ and ‘This is what Abercrombie isn’t’. The Abercrombie college kid drives a Jeep and he doesn’t drive a Sedan.”</p><p>The revamp was a hit and Abercrombie was worth over £760million by 1999. Former A&F design director Kelly Blumberg said: “The brand was on top. We had quarterly meetings and they were like massive pep rallies around the firepit to discuss the money we were making.”</p><p>In 2002, among A&F’s best-sellers were its irreverent logo T-shirts. It could knock them out cheap and charge an 85 per cent mark-up.</p><p>But the shirt designs sparked claims of racism. One depicted an ad for fictional business Wong Brothers Laundry Service and had two stereotypical Asian men above the tagline: “Two wongs make it white.”</p><p>Blogger Phil Yu said: “It’s taken from people’s understanding of Asians if you just watched American TV and movies. So it’s the kitschy font and caricatures of slant-eyed Asians.</p><p>“Asian-Americans are often taught to keep your head down, not rock the boat, as a lot of us are children of immigrants. But at that moment I was like, ‘It’s OK to be angry about this’.”</p><p>The T-shirt led to protests — and A&F burned its merchandise. It apologised but was criticised for continuing to stock a logo shirt with a donkey and taco that read: “Juan for the road.”</p><p>Two years later, further flak flew over A&F’s brutal hiring and firing policies. It emerged managers had to rank employees by how cool they were. Anyone who did not make the cut was quietly cut from the rota.</p><p>This befell black Carla Barrientos when she asked to work day shifts instead of nights. When her boss refused, she told him a colleague had offered to swap.</p><p>She said: “After that I was not on the schedule. I remember asking him, ‘What should I do? Do I still work here? I haven’t been on the schedule for two months’, and he’s like, ‘No, no, you do. Just keep calling us’. I knew I had been fired and I just moved on.”</p><p>The same thing happened to Jennifer Sheahan in Irvine, California. She alleged that after bosses from A&F’s HQ visited, her manager was told there were too many Asian staff and she was fired.</p><p>She said: “They noticed a bunch of Asian people in the store. They said ‘You need more staff who look like this’ and pointed to a poster and it was a Caucasian model’.”</p><p>The two employees and seven others sued A&F for race discrimination. Incredulously, its defence was that the employees were not good-looking enough for the shop floor.</p><p>A&F finally settled the case, paying out a reported 30million to thousands of employees but admitting no guilt. It also signed a court agreement to increase diversity but was later accused of ducking any real change.</p><p>Front-of-store staff were renamed “models” but Wall Street Journal journalist Moe Tkacik said: “The idea was that by calling their minimum-wage retail employees ‘models’, Abercrombie could get away with anything a modelling agency could.”</p><h2 id=unsavoury-rumours>UNSAVOURY RUMOURS</h2><p>There was also more trouble afoot — with the real models who posed in A&F’s Adonis-like ads. US photographer Bruce Weber shaped A&F’s aesthetic, essentially black-and-white shots of topless men running about or wrestling.</p><p>But Bobby Blanksi says there were unsavoury rumours about Bruce’s love of young men. He said: “There was a guy who would get a call from Bruce, get invited for dinner. They would go and I’d not see them the next day.”</p><p>Bobby claims that when when he turned Bruce down for dinner, during a shoot, minutes later he got a call cutting him from the job. Another model, Ryan Daharsh, added: “It was very well known with Bruce that he liked young men. You would put your hand on your chest and he put his hand on your hand — kind of like talking to relax.</p><p>“And then it was, ‘I’m going to lower your hand. Say when to stop.”</p><p>Ryan said: “My hand didn’t move.”</p><p>Weber was sued in 2017 by 20 models who say he sexually abused them — a claim he denies. In 2021 he settled two lawsuits for unknown sums, and has never admitted guilt.</p><p>Ryan added that Jeffries, although not accused of any harassment, would attend shoots. He said: “It was like he was just there to have fun. He was so weird. Who knows what the fk...I don’t know what that dude was into.”</p><p>Intensely private Jeffries had been in a heterosexual marriage, but is now with male partner Matthew Smith. Employees cited Jeffries’ alleged homophobia, too. One claimed he held up a pair of women’s corduroys and said: “Who the f*** are you designing for? Dykes on trikes?”</p><h2 id=alleged-homophobia>ALLEGED HOMOPHOBIA</h2><p>Staff were also handed an etiquette manual for when Jeffries flew on the company’s private jet. It read: “When Michael or a guest make a request, respond by saying, ‘No problem’. This should be used in place of phrases such as ‘sure’ or ‘just a minute’.”</p><p>But it was one interview Jeffries did in 2006 that really blew up.<br>In a chat with US news and opinion mag Salon, he said: “In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then the not-so-cool kids.</p><p>“Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong, and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.”</p><p>In 2015, Muslim blogger Samantha Elauf sued A&F after being turned down for a job for wearing a hijab.</p><p>Again, the firm came up with a unlikely defence — that her headscarf was akin to wearing a baseball cap to an interview. She said: “Their argument was that if they hired me I would hurt their brand.”</p><p>The Supreme Court rejected A&F’s defence, saying the firm violated the Civil Rights Act. — and its sales crashed again.</p><p>Jeffries quit in 2014, and refused to comment to Netflix. L Brands chair Les Wexler resigned in 2020 over misogyny claims and his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>With female CEO Fran Horowitz now heading A&F, woke marketing has helped it to its best sales since 2008.</p><p>But blogger Phil Yu said: “Can you really sell diversity when really what you’re trying to sell is a V-neck?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000725930802.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000725936622-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSCcn2YbW1uZ5GXsrOv0aikm6GVYq6vsIyfoK2bmGKwpruMpqCknV2fsqey0aKcrGWVpcC1scinZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jeff-probst-wife.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is the 'Survivor' Host Married?</a>
