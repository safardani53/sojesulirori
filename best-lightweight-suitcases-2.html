2023</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 11 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>A LIGHTWEIGHT suitcase can make all the difference to your stress levels when you’re travelling, but at the same time, you don’t want to sacrifice space for less weight, so the best lightweight suitcases are those that combine features with functionality.</p><p>Most airlines include a certain amount of checked luggage within the price of the flight, but some, especially budget airlines don’t, and there’s always a weight limit. While a carry-on may be sufficient for a few days away, it’s not going to cut it for a fortnight in the sun, at least not for those of us who insist on a certain level of comfort on our hols.</p><p>You don’t need to lug hard-shell luggage around with you though – the best lightweight suitcases are made from tough, water-resistant fabrics such as polyester and they are more than capable of surviving the vagaries of baggage handling.</p><p>Cut the luggage load, rather than the capacity, with one of these lightweight suitcases – they’re definitely not wimps in the packing stakes and they’ll help you get the best from your holiday wardrobe.</p><h2>Best lightweight suitcases at a glance:</h2><h2><strong>Antler Brixham</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Antler-brixham-lightweight-case.jpg><ul><li><strong>Antler Brixham in Navy (Medium) £210 from Antler – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lots of packing space, very light, expandable, inside pocket</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Price</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4.5/5</p><p>This suitcase is incredibly light at only 2.4kg and you can pack a lot into it! I easily managed to pack enough for 10 days away, including shoes, sandals and hair straighteners – and I’m not a light packer.</p><p>The front gives you one big pocket that you could use for storing a set of clothes so they’re readily available when you arrive at your destination – handy if you can’t be bothered to unpack right away. The pocket doesn’t lock though. Also good for storing newspapers or books bought at the airport.</p><p>Inside, the bottom (main) compartment has a good-sized zip pocket along the back for small items, and luggage straps to secure your clothes. There’s a zip divider in the lid to keep contents there separate from those in the bottom compartment and even better – the lid expands giving you even more packing space. Perfect for bringing home holiday buys.</p><p>The case is easy to manoeuvre on both hard floors and carpets, thanks to the 360° wheels. The telescopic handle has three positions and there’s a padded handle on the top, as well as a second padded handle on one side, and a grab handle on the bottom.</p><p>The Brixham has a TSA lock and comes with a lifetime warranty. It even comes with its own dust bag for storage, which is a lovely touch.</p><p>Also available in black.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>71 x 43.5 x 28cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.4kg<strong> capacity: </strong>74/88L</p><h2><strong>Rocklite DLX</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rock-rocklite-dlx.jpg><ul><li><strong>Rocklite DLX in khaki (medium), £104.99 from Rock – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Made from recycled material, really lightweight, good capacity, expandable</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not sure about the full-width telescopic handle</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4.5/5</p><p>Rock’s newest suitcase launches this month and it’s a commendable attempt to marry sustainability with practicality and style.</p><p>The Rocklite DLX is made from 100% recycled polyester and is extremely lightweight – weighing in at 2.6kg empty.</p><p>The outside of the case features a very large zipped pocket with a solid front, giving extra protection to whatever you store inside.</p><p>The two zips here fit into each other perfectly, so you could easily add a lock for extra security. There’s a second small pocket above, great for last-minute additions, but it’s not lockable so I’m thinking pen, paper, tissues, a book, that sort of thing.</p><p>There’s a handle on the top and a handle on the side, as well as a telescopic handle with three height-adjustable positions.</p><p>Unusually, the telescopic handle stretches the width of the case, which Rock says makes for better stability but I’m not sure about it; I found it a bit unwieldy.</p><p>The 360° wheels mean the suitcase is a dream to move around – and there are eight of them so even when it’s full, manoeuvrability is excellent.</p><p>Inside, you have one main compartment with luggage straps to hold everything in place, while the inside of the top section has two large zipped pockets – one in mesh so you can easily see what you’ve stored inside. Even at this weight it still manages to incorporate an expansion feature, giving you extra space for holiday buys.</p><p>The Rocklite DLX has a TSA lock and comes with a 15-year warranty. It’s available in denim blue, charcoal and purple as well as khaki.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>68 x 42 x 24cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.6kg<strong> capacity: </strong>45L/51L</p><h2><strong>Featherstone 4-Wheel Soft Suitcase</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Argos-featherstone-soft-case.jpg><ul><li><strong>Featherstone 4-Wheel Soft Suitcase (Large), £55 from Argos – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Price, lots of space</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Four wheels (rather than eight), no combination lock</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>This lightweight suitcase gives a lovely 86L capacity so there’s plenty of space for all of your clothes, shoes, toiletries and accessories.</p><p>The 360° wheels mean the suitcase is easy to move, but there are only four of them – perhaps eight would have been better, especially for manoeuvring the case when it’s full, but I guess that would have impacted the weight, not to mention the price.</p><p>Inside, the capacious main compartment has luggage straps to secure your clothes and there’s a full-size mesh pocket in the top.</p><p>Outside, there’s a large pocket on the front of the case for last-minute airport buys, but there’s no lock on this one. That said, the main zips fit into each other so you could easily add a padlock.</p><p>The case has a padded handle on one side and a grab handle on top, in addition to the telescopic handle. The four feet on the other side are a welcome feature.</p><p>Comes with a five-year guarantee.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>77 x 46.5 x 26.5cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.79kg<strong> capacity: </strong>86L</p><h2><strong>Tripp Chic</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tripp-Chic.jpg><ul><li><strong>Tripp Chic in Sky Blue (Medium), £65 from Tripp – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lightweight, price, expandable, fun colour</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Lack of inside pockets, no feet</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>Summer’s coming and this sky-blue suitcase has a real holiday vibe. I know looks aren’t everything, but if you can have a suitcase in a fun colour that looks good, why wouldn’t you?</p><p>Practically speaking, where the Tripp Chic really stands out is in its weight – 3.2kg empty which is pretty impressive for a hard shell suitcase of this size. I could easily lift it with one hand.</p><p>The four wheels have 360° movement, and when empty the case is easy to pull. The telescopic handle feels a little flimsy for the size of the case when it’s full and it is a bit more difficult to manoeuvre.</p><p>There’s a soft grip handle on the top of the case and another on one side, which makes the case comfortable to carry. However, there are no feet if you were to set it down on its side, which means you could easily scratch the exterior.</p><p>Inside, the bottom section has luggage straps to secure your clothes and the top section has a mesh cover with zip around three sides, so you can keep the contents here separate and secure.</p><p>But why no interior pockets? It’s a shame as they’re so handy for storing bits and pieces you don’t want just lying loose inside. The top section is expandable, giving you a useful six litre extra capacity if you’ve hit the shops too hard and you’re short on space.</p><p>The Chic has a TSA lock and comes with a five-year guarantee.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>67x45x28/31cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>3.2kg<strong> capacity: </strong>66/72L</p><h2><strong>Craghoppers 22” Wheelie</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cragghopers-wheelie.jpg><ul><li><strong>Craghoppers 22” Wheelie, £170 from Craghoppers – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Loads of pockets – including laptop pocket, RFID pocket</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Expensive</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p><p>The Craghoppers Wheelie is designed to hold your laptop, iPad, chargers and any other essential equipment you may be taking on a work trip, with separate pockets for all of these. It also features an RFID pocket and cut resistant panel on the front.</p><p>Inside, there’s space for your clothes in the bottom compartment and in the top, which features a zipped divider. The khaki lining, luggage straps, zip and edging add a stylish touch.</p><p>The two wheels sadly don’t move through 360° and I noticed a bit of resistance when pulling the case across a hard floor, but they are chunky and look like they’re built to last.</p><p>Though the case doesn’t come with a lock it’s easy to add one as the main zips fit together. There’s also luggage straps on the outside for extra security.</p><p>The telescopic handle feels sturdy and the soft grip underneath is really comfortable to hold. There’s a padded handle on the top also, and thin handles on the side and front pockets.</p><p>Comes with a five-year guarantee.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>55 x 34 x 24cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.7kg<strong> capacity: </strong>40L</p><h2><strong>Vonhaus Cabin Case</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Vonhaus-pink-cabin-case-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Vonhaus Pink Hard Shell Cabin Case, £42.99 – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Price, good internal layout</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No side handle</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p><p>We love the subtle pink of this cabin case, which has a 35L capacity, so is ideal for a day or two away from home, whether you’re relaxing on a city break, or travelling for work.</p><p>It’s made from ABS plastic so it’s robust, yet light, and it has four 360° wheels for easy manoeuvrability on hard floors and carpet.</p><p>Inside, the design is practical: the bottom compartment has a zip pocket at the back and luggage straps to hold everything in place, while the top compartment features a zipped divider and within that, a large, zipped mesh pocket.</p><p>The telescopic handle has three positions and there’s also a soft-grip handle on the top, though none on the side. It also has a combination lock.</p><p><strong>Specification – Size: </strong>55 x 37 x 21cm <strong>weight when empty: </strong>2.5kg<strong> capacity: </strong>35L</p><h2>Away The Medium</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Away-The-Medium.webp><ul><li><strong>Away The Medium suitcase, £315 from Away - </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>buy here</strong></a></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Built to last, lifetime warranty, internal pockets</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Price</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4.5/5</p><p>Away’s The Medium measures 66cm x 47cm x 28cm, and is a decent size for most trips.</p><p>We loved that the different compartments made it super easy to pack, and there’s also a waterproof laundry bag included so you can enjoy a last minute dip in the pool before a flight out without worrying about all your stuff getting wet.</p><p>The £315 price tag is hefty but that’s because the suitcase is covered by a limited lifetime warranty - if anything goes wrong, they will just fix it or replace it.</p><p>For those who aren’t sure about splashing out, Away offers a 100-day trial on any unpersonalised suitcases so you can see whether it’s a good fit for you and return it if it’s not.</p><p>Read our full review of the Away medium suitcase <a href=# rel=noopener>here.</a></p><p><strong>Specs – Size: </strong>H66 x W47 x D28cm<strong> weight:</strong> 4.5kg <strong>capacity:</strong> 66.8L</p><p><h2>Where to buy lightweight suitcases in the UK</h2></p><p>You can buy lightweight suitcases in stores on the high street, in specialist luggage shops, department and chain stores, as well as online. We found the suitcases in our roundup at:</p><h2>How much do lightweight suitcases cost?</h2><p>There's a huge range in prices of suitcases so consider what features are most important to you.</p><p>The suitcase material, weight and capacity will all impact the price - as well as the brand - and we saw prices range from £30 to almost £400.</p><p>It may be worth paying a slightly higher price as a suitcase is an investment purchase that should last you years - and if not, be covered by a decent warranty.</p><h2>What is the best lightweight suitcase to buy?</h2><p>This depends on whether you're looking for a cabin, medium or large case and the features that matter to you most - such as a TSA lock, expandable space, style or cost.</p><p>For great value, we loved the IT luggage range at Argos and also the Tripp Ultra-lite cabin suitcase at Amazon.</p><p>If you're looking to spend a bit more for a long-term investment, the new Antler Clifton case is sure to turn a few heads.</p><h2>What is considered lightweight luggage?</h2><p>A lightweight cabin bag or medium case should come in around 2 - 3kg.</p><p>For the larger suitcases, you might expect to see weights of 3.5 - 5kg and this would still be deemed as lightweight.</p><h2>What to look for in lightweight luggage</h2><p>Look out for the capacity of the case as well as the weight to ensure you're getting plenty of packing space for your money.</p><p>Consider the casing material as you want something durable, hardwearing and ideally scratch resistant as luggage often gets thrown around a fair bit on your travels.</p><p>Also, consider security features such as a TSA approved lock and secure zips - as well as compartments and straps to keep your things in place.</p><p>Finally, check out the warranty - as these can vary from just one year to 30 years! - and also look at&nbsp;exactly what is included in the cover, as this also varies from brand to brand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpqYWd%2FeoCQaJmeq6Riuaqzx62unqGXncFuv9Siq5yZo5rAbn6O</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cardi-b-shares-extremely-nsfw-proof-that-offset-isnt-cheating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cardi B Shares Extremely NSFW Proof that Offset Isn't Cheating</a>
