cured her painful rash with a £10.95 “miracle” cream.</strong></p><p>Rosalind McClean had been struggling with perioral dermatitis for more than five years – and as a consequence suffered from a scaly, red rash around her mouth that constantly stung.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JamPress_Skin_Cream_Cure_008.jpg><p>The 75-year-old was prescribed a steroid cream after visiting her GP but was dubious about using it after finding out that the crippling dermatitis could potentially return if she were to stop.</p><p>Rosalind, from Northern Ireland, abandoned her prescription and began searching for a potential cure without harmful chemicals.</p><p>Her situation soon became worse as the painful rash began to spread around her eyes and nose, a condition known as periocular dermatitis.</p><p>Due to the location of her condition, Rosalind avoided social outings and her confidence plummeted.</p><p>She said: “The perioral and periocular dermatitis really lowered my self-confidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610604875.jpg> <img

people were looking at me, wondering what was wrong with my face, and if it was infectious.</p><p>"I wouldn’t go out of the house without a full face of makeup, researched makeup, and tried to find the most natural one I could.</p><p>"I was still worried about using it, in case it would make the PD worse, so the makeup went on immediately before I had to go out, and the moment I was home it was removed.”</p><p>She said she avoided social occasions and would steer clear of those where she didn’t already know people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610604872.jpg><p>“I had days when my mood was low, especially after a new flare up on my face”, she added.</p><p>A fellow sufferer recommended that Rosalind try zinc, an essential nutrient found in cells throughout the body, which helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses – it helped for a while but was not a permanent solution.</p><p>Rosalind said she decided to try a baby nappy rash cream and purchased Sudocrem to use at night.</p><p>"It made my face white, so I didn’t want to use it during the day.</p><p>“The zinc did soothe the rash, but also made my skin very dry, so now I was looking for a good natural moisturiser.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

dermatitis?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Perioral dermatitis is a rash that develops around the mouth and tends to be bumpy or scaly.</p><p>In most cases the bumps will appear away from the lips and can be irritating.</p><p>The bumps can be skin coloured but can also appear to be red or pink and in some cases they can resemble acne.</p><p>There is no underlying cause of the condition and it is not contagious.</p><p>Possible causes include:</p><ul><li>hormonal changes</li><li>taking birth control such as the pill</li><li>an allergic reaction</li><li>a problem with the skin's barrier</li><li>UV light</li><li>a change in bacteria in the skin</li></ul><p>It was then that she discovered Lyonsleaf company that creates hand-made, natural skincare products, including a <a href=#>calendula cream</a> that transformed her face.</p><p>The product costs just £10.95 and is now part of Rosalind’s daily routine.</p><p>She said: “My routine then became calendula cream during the day with Sudocrem at night, and I started to notice improvement on my face”, adding that she also purchased some zinc powder and mixed it in with the cream.</p><p>“My perioral dermatitis was a thing of the past within about four weeks."</p><p>Rosalind's skin is now “better than ever,” and she even goes make-up free when leaving the house, something she would never have dreamed of doing before.</p><p>The 75-year-old adds that she now spends a very small percentage of what she used to spend on products for her skin.</p><p>She said: “I think of the money I used to spend on all sorts of lotions and potions, and what the chemicals in them were doing to my face, and shudder.</p><p>“Now I spend a very small percentage of what I used to spend, and know what I put on my skin is actually nourishing it. It's a lot easier on the bank account.”</p><p>Sadly, nearly two years ago, Rosalind was diagnosed with throat cancer and was forced to undergo radiotherapy, which can affect the skin in the treated area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610604635.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health News</h2></p><p>She said: “The hospital gave me a paraffin-based cream to use on the skin of my neck, and I took one look at it and decided it wouldn’t be used.</p><p>"Instead, I used Lyonsleaf’s Calendula and Marshmallow Balm, and every time I saw my oncologist she examined the skin of my neck and commented on how well it was doing.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Thankfully, Rosalind is now cancer-free, although she does have lasting side effects of her treatment, such as being unable to eat solid foods and being dependent on supplements to maintain her weight.</p><p>“To me, it’s a small price to pay for being cancer-free,” she adds.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Video of farmers battling processionary caterpillars, whose tiny toxic hairs cause irritation and dermatitis</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn94gphpanJnp6S6orqMqaOan6WasW6%2FyqKlZpufo7GqwMiopWabpaeybn2PZnBuZZ2ev6Kvy55knKqVlrpw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ava-max-felt-like-new-person-after-ditching-her-signature-lopsided-max-cut-hair.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ava Max 'Felt Like a New Person' After Ditching Her Signature Hair</a>
