Steve excluded both Damian and his other daughter Kira Kerkorian, 21, from his will almost two decades&nbsp;before his suicide, court documents obtained by The Sun revealed.</p><p>"None of it’s really my story, because it’s all to do with Damian," Liz said.</p><p>"All I can say is that it was great to connect again with someone who… we had loved each other, very much.
