He was there to witness the birth of his daughter, Stella Taylor Shanahan, on August 7, 2007. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He even "coached" through the delivery. He held it together until she was born.</p><p>However, as soon as she was born, he started crying. Shanahan also became more mature after her birth, or that's what his wife said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"He's so much more responsible," Mandy said at the time. Stella became his priority immediately. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He didn't feel the maturity right away, though.&nbsp;"I still feel like a kid," he quipped a month after welcoming his daughter. He felt like the same person he always was.</p><p>While Shanahan was working with his team, it was Mandy who handled Stella and the family. He credited his wife for being strong and handling the baby while he was away.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He was so in love with his daughter that he would, at times, ignore Mandy. He was hyper-careful with her and thought she was "perfect." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Kyle Shanahan and Mandy's Married Life</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Shanahan and Mandy <a href=# rel="follow noopener">met each other</a> while attending Cherry Creek High School in Denver, Colorado. He was one year his senior. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They started dating only after she graduated from high school.</p><p>But their love story isn't without bumps. They broke up soon after because they were attending different colleges but remained close friends.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It took a tragedy to pull them together again. When Mandy's mother Nancy was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, Shanahan took care of her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In fact, that was when she knew he was the&nbsp;one. "After going through that with him, I couldn't imagine being with anyone else," she admitted to SFGate.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Kyle Shanahan with his wife Mandy and three kids.</strong> (Photo: Eric Branch/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Shanahan had never thought of getting married young. Mandy made him change his plans about that.</p><p>The couple got married on July 5, 2005.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Stella became a sister around 2009 as Shanahan and Mandy had their second kid, son Carter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The coach, who is known for&nbsp;his love of hip hop, might have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">named him</a> after Lil Wayne, given that his real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Then came Lexi, their third and youngest, in around 2013.</p><p>Shanahan&nbsp;has made his family move around a lot due to his job.
