Braced by the strength of her single mother, Taylor earned a college degree and now runs a successful business in cybersecurity.</p><p>In addition, Taylor, 30, has written a memoir, “A Letter To My Dead Beat Dad: The Facade Is Over,” detailing her father and his leaving the family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Writing The Memoir</h2><p>Taylor is the perfect example of someone who had to fight intense battles and turn their pain and trauma into something productive.&nbsp;</p><p>While her mother was her biggest role model, she found three more in her grandmother and two teachers, Mrs. Pittman and Coach Fahrner, from school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Taylor-Coleman-Writes-A-Tell-All-Memoir-Source_Medium.jpg><p>She claims that the two teachers always treated her kindly and instilled the kindness they always had for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Her grandmother, on her mother’s side, was another woman in her life who epitomized strength and resilience.</p><p>According to Taylor, her grandmother grew up very poor. However, she never lost the gift of seeing life with kind eyes and made a beautiful life for herself.</p><p>When Taylor began writing, she didn’t know what she was getting herself into. However, she claims the experience proved both exhausting and uplifting.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, she wrote this memoir because she knew she had a story to tell. She believed that some people could relate to the story and find a semblance of comfort.</p><p>In a recent interview, she said, “I spent my whole life keeping my abandonment and trauma a secret.” She added, “I want the readers to know my anger and sadness, as well as feel the love that I still have for my father.”</p><p>She claimed she met him years later, at a Cardinals store in 2022. However, the former athlete refused to answer her questions and wouldn’t meet his daughter’s eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor is still hopeful that she will have a relationship with her father. She stated she is still close with her half-brothers from his father’s first marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdqa66uM6rZJynnJq6orqMr6Cnm5VisLC4xKaYp2WUlsKotNOeqWavmaC2bq3GnmY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./scientology-leah-remini-hears-former-members-tragic-story-w458358.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Scientology': Leah Remini Hears Former Member's Tragic Story</a>
