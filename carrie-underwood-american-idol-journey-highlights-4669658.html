The then-21-year-old, showed up wearing a simple, off-the-shoulder-pink t-shirt and jeans and also sported her shoulder-length blonde hair in numerous curls, all smiles and as sweet as could be. Although she was visibly nervous, and told judge <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Randy Jackson</a>&nbsp;</strong>she was scared of known tough guy <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Simon Cowell</a></strong>, she beautifully belted out&nbsp;<strong>Bonnie Raitt</strong>‘s “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” much the judges’ — which also included <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paula Abdul</strong></a> — delight. She was given the golden ticket to Hollywood to continue on in the competition.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After telling Randy her favorite singer was&nbsp;<strong>Martina McBride</strong>, Simon said, “I was saying to someone the other day, ‘I’m surprised that we haven’t found a good country singer in this competition yet.’” Little did they know what was to come!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I was so distracted that when Mom and Dad were driving me to the airport to go to Hollywood, I realized I’d forgotten lip liner,” Carrie said of her audition in a 2020 essay for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Guideposts</a>. “We stopped at a grocery store, and Mom dashed inside to buy some. All at once, it was just too much. Going out to Los Angeles by myself, competing with all those other people who were so talented. I burst into tears.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>She continued, “My dad turned to me in the backseat. ‘Carrie,’ he said, ‘we can go home right now, and we don’t ever have to talk about it again.’” Lucky for us, the talented performer decided to move forward in the competition!</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She was still studying at Northeastern State University while competing</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>A little known fact about Carrie was that she was still enrolled in school as she took to Idol, studying at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma.

Moreover, during the top 11 finalists’ performances, after Carrie performed Heart’s “Alone,” the British judge predicted she would not only win the competition overall, but become one of the best-selling&nbsp;Idol&nbsp;winners.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>It wasn’t just Simon who was seriously smitten with Carrie. One of the show’s producers later said she dominated the voting every week, often winning by a long shot.
