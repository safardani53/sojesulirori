He was one of just a few NCAA players to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.</p><p>Unlike other players, he spoke publicly in college about his lifelong issue with anxiety, which made front-page news because only a few sportsmen at the time discussed their mental health openly.</p><p>White discovered the NBA lacked a mental health policy during his rookie season. As a result, they both pushed back forcefully.</p><p>The player missed the start of NBA camp on October 1, in order to work out a contract with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league’s mental health policy, or lack thereof.</p><p>Following consultations with his own long-term doctor, White asked for authorization to travel by bus when required in order to keep his flight schedule to a minimum.</p><p>The Rockets and Royce reached an arrangement on travel, which included permitting White to go by personal bus rather than flying. Before this deal, the player missed the first week of training camp.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, a few games into the season, Royce had a disagreement with the team over the irregularity of how mental health was handled.</p><p>He emphasized the risk of team executives being able to make judgments on mental health and health while having no mental health expertise.

The problem remained unsolved by the conclusion of the week.</p><h3>Continuing Advocacy</h3><p>NBA reached an impasse as Royce continued to campaign openly for a mental health policy. Royce, who was at that time, 21, refused to play another NBA game until a thorough policy was in place.</p><p>It was a position made as much for himself as for his fellow players, the whole league, and the world that it affected.</p><p>Royce believed that the struggle stretched well beyond Royce, who views the NBA as an ideal platform for bringing the topic of mental health out into the open, exemplifying reform and eradicating stigma.</p><p>And, gradually, as more NBA players have come forth in the past years to speak about their inner battles, and as coaches and general managers have joined the dialogue, the NBA is beginning to show indications of change.</p><h2>Royce White: Political Career&nbsp;</h2><p>Following the murder of George Floyd, White spearheaded multiple protests. Royce led a nonviolent demonstration in late May that drew hundreds of people down Interstate 35.</p><p>He also walked from 38th St. and Chicago Ave., the site of Floyd’s killing, to the White House beginning September 11, through battleground states like Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Royce-White-leading-the-protest-rally-following-the-murder-of-Floyd.jpg><p>During the demonstrations, the player also pushed for economic involvement in the Black community.</p><h3>Free The Uyghurs</h3><p>After Covid-19 lockdowns suspended its season in 2020, The BIG 3 resumed playing in 2021.
