Mysterio's eye pops out during brutal Extreme Rules match</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 Â· 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>IT might be considered entertainment, but wrestling can hurt.</strong></p><p>Just ask these WWE stars who have suffered eye-watering injuries while in action in the squared circle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596936276.jpg><p>During Sunday night's Extreme Rules, <a href=#>Mexican Rey Mysterio was horrifically hurt in 'The Horror Show' clash with Seth Rollins</a>, where the winner was decided by who extracted the eye of their opponent first.</p><p>After becoming the victor, Rollins was seen puking by the side of the ring with Mysterio rolling around in agony and his eye-ball bulging out from his mask nearby.</p><p>It's not the first time a WWE staple has seen their career threatened by a serious injury.</p><p>Here's nine more, with some having to end their careers early.</p><h2>'STONE COLD' STEVE AUSTIN</h2><p>At 1997's SummerSlam Owen Hart clashed with Austin in a match-up for the Intercontinental Championship.</p><p>Little did 'Stone Cold' realise that he would sustain an injury that would haunt him throughout his wrestling career.</p><p>When Hart performed a Piledriver on Austin, he left his foe with a broken neck.</p><p>Somehow, Austin managed to win the match, even though it looked like he wasn't able to continue.</p><p>Afterwards, he suffered with temporary paralysis and was the beginning of many neck issues that plagued Austin going forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596933539.jpg><h2>MICK FOLEY</h2><p>What hasn't happened to Foley?</p><p>The wrestling legend took on The Undertaker in 1998 in a 'Hell in a Cell' match and ended up with a staggering amount of injuries.</p><p>Multiple puncture wounds, a bust lip, as well as a dislocated shoulder and jaw.</p><p>But the most visible was seen at the end of the match, when he grinned towards the camera.</p><p>He had his tooth coming out his nose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596933546.jpg><h2>THE UNDERTAKER</h2><p>Facial injuries are part and parcel of the WWE.</p><p>All the slaps, scratches and punches can definitely lead to some long-lasting damage.</p><p>The Undertaker, <a href=#>who has since retired after a series of back problems</a>, suffered a broken orbital bone after a match against Mabel in 1995.</p><p>Luckily enough, the incident didn't affect his vision and he didn't lose his eye.</p><p>The Deadman soon returned to the ring with a Phantom of the Opera-style mask covering his face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596933545.jpg><h2>SHAWN MICHAELS</h2><p>The setting was the 1998 Royal Rumble, and the stakes couldn't have been higher.</p><p>Michaels was taking on The Undertaker in a Casket Match in one of the most eagerly anticipated wrestling events of all time.</p><p>When The Undertaker used a Back Body Drop to throw Michaels over the top rope and onto the floor disaster struck.</p><p>Michaels suffered two herniated discs, including one that was completely destroyed.</p><p>He was forced to relinquish his WWE Championship title at WrestleMania XIV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596933538.jpg><h2>BIG SHOW</h2><p>This time it wasn't even a wrestler who did the damage!</p><p>In a match against Rey Mysterio, a mystery guest watching all the action decided he had enough of Big Show pummelling 'The Biggest Little Man'.</p><p>Step forward Floyd Mayweather, who climbed into the ring and was allowed to strike the cocky Big Show, who was goading him.</p><p>'Money Mayweather' hit Big Show so hard he broke his nose.</p><p>Rumour has it, Big Show wanted Mayweather to strike him that hard because he wanted to get the crowd worked up... that'll do it!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000331790771.jpg><h2>RANDY ORTON</h2><p>To 2008 and One Night Stand for our next gruesome injury.</p><p>Orton was taking on Triple H for the WWE Championship belt, with both willing to put their bodies on the line.</p><p>However, the match was best remembered for a pretty awful moment for Orton.</p><p>When he was thrown over the top rope by Triple H, he made a hard landing and broke his collarbone.</p><p>Orton had to wait five months before he could return to the ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596934934.jpg><h2>DROZ</h2><p>In 1999, in a match against DâLo Brown that wasn't aired, Droz was left paralysed during a SmackDown match.</p><p>He suffered two fractured discs and became quadriplegic.</p><p>Droz has since gained some use of his upper body, but he remains paralysed below the waist.</p><p>The WWE have kept him loosely involved since the incident, while Droz told Brown he wasn't to blame for the accident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596933540-1.jpg><h2>JOHN CENA</h2><p>This must be why he's now a Hollywood actor.</p><p>Cena suffered a crippling torn pectoral as he took on Mr Kennedy, after he went for a Hip Toss.</p><p>Immediately, he pulled up after it went wrong, clutching his chest.</p><p>In fact, you could see the torn pec muscle hanging off his chest, it was <strong>THAT</strong> bad.</p><p>Cena missed several months of WWE action because of the injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596934927.jpg><h2>NIKKI BELLA</h2><p><a href=#>One of half of The Bella Twins</a>, Nikki formerly announced her retirement in 2019.</p><p>After years of punishment on her body, enough was enough.</p><p>The biggest issue she had was a herniated disc behind her vertebrae, more commonly known as a broken neck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a669c202-4c30-4676-b13b-f4cb95597a7b.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in WWE</h2></p><p>That, and a brain cyst, meant her days in the ring were over.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"I herniated the disk above where I had surgery, I have all this inflammation around the metal, and then I have a cyst on my brain," Nikki revealed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>"So, they were like, 'You're done, no
