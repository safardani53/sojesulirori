Micki Kanesaki Murder Charges &amp;amp; Law Firm</h1><div id=sub-header>March 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Lonnie Kocontes</strong> is a convicted killer receiving a life sentence in prison.<strong> Kocontes murdered his ex-wife, Micki Kanesaki</strong>, and dumped her corpse in the sea off the coast of Italy.&nbsp;In June 2020, he was convicted of murder for financial gain under extraordinary circumstances after a months-long trial. He was subsequently condemned to life in prison without the possibility of release.</p><p>The newest edition of NBC Dateline, “Open Water,” reveals the story of Micki Kanesaki’s murder. The episode emphasizes greed, treachery, and ruthlessness. Today’s story on Lonnie Kocontes discusses his past and how he murdered his ex-wife to death in order to receive a large sum of money.</p><h2>Lonnie Kocontes Bio And Wikipedia: Age And Nationality</h2><p><strong>Lonnie Kocontes</strong> is a former attorney. He used to be a lawyer in California. For a long period, the convicted felon worked as a lawyer. He nearly committed a perfect crime since he understood the law so well.&nbsp;He couldn’t, however, escape his wrongdoings. Lonnie Kocontes was born at the end of the 1950s. Kocontes is therefore in his mid-sixties as of this writing.</p><p>In terms of nationality, Lonnie is an American. He and his ex-wife resided in California. Little is known about his family history or educational background. The previous attorney, however, must have received his legal degree from one of the famous colleges.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lonnie-Kocontes-1.jpg alt="Lonnie Kocontes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Lonnie Kocontes murdered his wife, Micki Kanesaki</h2><p><strong>Micki Kanesaki</strong> was the second wife of Lonnie Loren Kocontes. On May 21, 2006, the couple went from California to Spain and embarked on a cruise. Four days later, the couple went to Messina, Italy, before returning to the yacht in the evening.&nbsp;According to some accounts, Micki was last seen by observers onboard after 11 p.m. that evening. And Lonnie said that he found Micki was gone when he awakened at 4:30 a.m.</p><p>Soon after, Lonnie notified police, claiming she had fallen from their room’s balcony after being unwell from drinking too much wine.&nbsp;On May 27, 2006, a search team uncovered the corpse of Micki Kanesaki, 52. Micki’s ex-husband returned to his own country on the same day.&nbsp;Kanesaki was formed while floating in the Mediterranean Sea, right off the coast of Paola, Italy.</p><h2>Arrest and Charges Against Lonnie Kocontes</h2><p><strong>Lonnie and Micki divorced in 2002</strong>, although they continued to live together for a while as they divided their possessions. The victim’s ex-wife did not become a suspect right away.&nbsp;The Kanesakis even claimed to have reconciled and intended to remarry.&nbsp;However, it wasn’t until the autopsy revealed Micki’s cause of death. According to the findings, there was no water in the 52-year-old’s lungs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lonnie-Kocontes-2.jpg alt="Lonnie Kocontes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition, she had serious hemorrhaging around her neck as a consequence of strangling.&nbsp;Despite becoming a suspect early in the investigation, he was freed because he claimed to have reunited with Micki.&nbsp;However, he was again under FBI investigation in 2008 for trying to transfer $1 million between multiple bank accounts belonging to his late wife.&nbsp;However, when his third wife, Amy Nguyen, whom he had married and divorced before Micki’s death, testified in his favor before a federal grand jury, he was exonerated. The case against him was dismissed once again.</p><p>Furthermore, the case was selected by the Orange County District Attorney’s Office after some time. Amy Nguyen revised her narrative in 2013 and admits to lying before.&nbsp;As a consequence, in the same year, Lonnie Kocontes was charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors said that the culprit planned his acts meticulously, so he requested a balcony room on the trip.&nbsp;They further said that Lonnie not only brutally murdered his second wife, but also tried to assassinate his third wife when she testified against him.&nbsp;Finally, in June 2020, Kocontes was found guilty of the crimes leveled against him and was sentenced to jail.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuM6npaKdXaC8pLvNrZysZZ2esKy1jKSYp52jlriqecyuqZ2domKwqa3RoJysZZyWxG6yyKukaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./capricorn-goat-monthly-horoscope-december-2020.html>&#171;&nbsp;Capricorn Goat Monthly horoscope: What your Chinese and Western zodiac sign has in store for you</a>
