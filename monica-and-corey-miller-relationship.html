The incident happened in 2002, and several witnesses have since recanted the stories they told at his trial.

He was sentenced to life in prison at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. In January of last year, a judge deemed the two witnesses who had recanted their testimony unreliable and denied Miller's motion for a new trial. The witnesses said that Miller was not the shooter, and that they felt pressured to lie under oath. Now, he has advocates fighting for his release.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@cmurder & I are bonded by truth, honesty & Loyalty !

"The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him [sic] to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted," Kim wrote. "Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict."&nbsp;</p><p>"True justice for the young man requires that the person who actually killed him be held responsible and that Corey Miller be returned home to his kids," she continued.
