He also reprised his role as Captain Boomerang in the film sequel of 2016’s Suicide Squad titled The Suicide Squad.</p><p>The action-adventure movie was directed by James Gunn. The movie’s cast consists of Margot Robbie, John Cena, Idris Elba, and Taika Waititi. The movie premiered in the United Kingdom on July 30, 2021, and in the United States on August 5, 2021.</p><p>As for his recent acting credits, in 2022, he appeared in Black Site, Love, Death & Robots, and The Terminal List; and in 2023, he appeared as Bob Goodwin in Kaleidoscope and as a Narrator in For the Love of Pets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jai Courtney was in a committed relationship</h2><p>The Sydney, New South Wales native actor is yet to share the wedding vows and settle down with a wife. There have been no reports of him getting married to a wife presently or in the past.</p><p>So, if he doesn’t have a wife, then is he dating a girlfriend in 2023? The answer to that question is also the same, as there has been no news of him seeing a partner at the moment. He has been keeping his love life private, and nothing hints he is currently dating a girlfriend.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, before his relationship status became single, he was in a committed relationship with his now-former girlfriend Mecki Dent. Dent is an Adelaide-born national publicity coordinator for Paramount Pictures and a former PR coordinator for the Aussie fashion label named Sass & Bide.</p><p>The couple reportedly started dating circa 2015, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://apnews.com/article/ef8c71b9a2314eb19513cf6a51a8e331 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to AP News</a>. But although they began dating in 2015, their togetherness <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">came out</a> only a year later when Dent accompanied her beau during the red carpet premiere event of 2016’s Suicide Squad in New York.</p><p>A few days later, the two’s romantic connection made headlines as they showed PDA by kissing each other during Suicide Squad’s London premiere. Since then, they were public about their romance.</p><p>In March 2017, the actor even admitted to AP News that he was madly in love with Dent and hoped to spend his whole life with her, claiming she was the woman of his dreams. He stated, “I feel I’ve met the woman of my dreams and this is it, I hope.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/jai-courtney-married-wife-girlfriend-career.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jai Courtney with his ex-girlfriend, Mecki Dent, at the premiere of 2016’s ‘Suicide Squad’ (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>As time passed, they began to travel together, go on vacations, and celebrate festivals — making their bond stronger. Their togetherness was also witnessed through their respective Instagram handles — those posts have since been deleted.</p><p>For instance, on January 11, 2019, Dent shared a cute selfie captured alongside her partner with the former captioning it by writing “[ stolen moments ].”</p><p>And on the occasion of his girlfriend’s birthday, May 6, 2021, Courtney shared some snaps of her and captioned them by writing “Chaos & Magic. happy bday my love.”</p><p>Going by all that, fans thought Courtney and Dent were here to stay and would even get married at some point in the future. However, that wasn’t the case, as the same fans began suspecting that the duo had split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jai-courtney-former-girlfriend-Mecki-dent.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jai Courtney with his now-former girlfriend Mecki Dent (Photo: Twitter)</p><p>Fans began wondering about Courtney and Dent’s possible breakup after both of them deleted pictures of each other from their respective Instagram handles in 2022. And those pictures have remained deleted to this date.</p><p>So, it became confirmed that the fan queries of “jai courtney mecki dent married” won’t be happening” and “jai courtney mecki dent split” had already happened. That said, the actual date of their split and the reason behind their breakup remains unknown, as neither of them has spoken about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jai Courtney’s dating history explored</h2><p>Before developing such a strong bond with Dent, Courtney was previously engaged in a couple of <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/news/harrison-osterfield-girlfriend-gracie-james/ rel="noreferrer noopener">dating relationships</a>, the most renowned being his relationship with a fellow Aussie actress, Gemma Pranita.</p><p>Courtney and Pranita started <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dating</a> each other in 2006. They were open about their relationship and occasionally appeared in public. However, they weren’t meant to be together as the two decided to split after 7 years of relationship in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jai-Courtney-with-his-ex-girlfriend-Gemma-Pranita.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jai Courtney with his ex-girlfriend Gemma Pranita (Source: Herald Sun)</p><p>Two years after he broke up with Pranita, in 2015, the Terminator Genisys actor was linked to Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke. But, the rumors were never confirmed. Later, he began dating his current partner, Mecki Dent.</p><p>As for Courtney’s present girlfriend, Dent, she was in a long-term relationship with the Fox Sports presenter named Ben Way. Other than that, there is no news of her past relationships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A brief look into Jai Courtney’s acting career</h2><p>The 6 feet 1-inch tall actor’s first step in becoming an actor was getting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enrolled</a> at a drama school named Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). Then, after a brief time of graduation, he finally stepped foot in the entertainment industry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Courtney’s first <a href=# rel=noopener>acting role</a> came in 2005 when he portrayed the role of Alex in a short movie titled Boys Grammar. Three years later, he made his television debut through the TV series, All Saints. In the same year, he also starred in another TV series named Packed to the Rafters.</p><p>From 2009 to 2017, he made his appearance in several acting gigs, including Stone Bros. (2009), Spartacus (2010), A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), Terminator Genisys (2015), The Exception (2016), and Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later (2017).</p><p>In 2019 and 2020, he portrayed some amazing roles in movies and TV series, such as Buffaloed (as Wizz), Brothers in Arms (as Callahan), Stateless (as Cam Sandford), and Honest Thief (as John Nivens).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In 2021, he only appeared in two movies, Jolt and The Suicide Squad. But that changed in 2022 as he appeared in Black Site, Love, Death & Robots, and The Terminal List. And in 2023, he appeared as Bob Goodwin in Kaleidoscope and as a Narrator in For the Love of Pets.</p><p>Furthermore, he already has three upcoming acting projects: American Primeval (as Virgil Cutter), The Fox, and Catching Dust (as Clyde).
