The film was given its full title in January 2020, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DisInsider</a>,&nbsp;and filming was scheduled to begin in April 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

M. Barrie’s story to life. The original story followed Wendy and her brothers John and Michael, as they met Peter Pan, on a night when their parents had announced that it would be Wendy’s last night in the nursery and that she’d needed to grow up. Peter arrived in the middle of the night and helped the children fly away to Neverland, where they meet the Lost Boys, and a wide cast of other characters, including some (now well-known to be problematic) Native Americans, mermaids, and of course, pirates. The pirates eventually capture the Darlings and the Lost Boys, after trying to kill Peter. Peter flies in to save the day, and the kids face off with the pirates, eventually taking over the ship and flying back to London, where Mr. Darling has decided that Wendy can stay in the nursery for some time longer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The official synopsis for Peter Pan & Wendy reads: “Peter Pan & Wendy introduces Wendy Darling,<span class=x_apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>a<span class=x_apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>young girl afraid to leave her childhood home behind, who meets Peter Pan, a boy who refuses to grow up. Alongside her brothers and a tiny fairy, Tinker Bell, she travels with Peter to the magical world of Never Land. There, she encounters an evil pirate captain, Captain Hook, and embarks on a thrilling and dangerous adventure that will change her life forever.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> first trailer</a> that was released in February 2023 showed what the live-action film will be about. It shows Wendy Darling meeting the Lost Boys, including Peter Pan, in Neverland. “What do you say boys? Are you ready for an adventure?” Wendy says to her brothers as they travel to Neverland. The trailer also features Yara’s Tinker Bell, who helps the Darlings go to Neverland. We also catch a glimpse of Jude’s Captain Hook, who approaches the Darlings with a sword, searching for Peter Pan.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This year, return to Neverland. ✨ Watch the trailer for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#PeterPanAndWendy</a> and stream the movie event April 28 only on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@DisneyPlus</a>. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/c6BCiaAwmP</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>— Walt Disney Studios (@DisneyStudios) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 28, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-20>While the original movie is still regarded as a classic for Disney Animation, hindsight has shown that the portrayal of Native Americans was incredibly problematic. Disney seems to have taken the past portrayal into account with the new movie. Alyssa Wapanatâhk is an indigenous actress playing the part, and a report showed that Disney was seemingly giving Tiger Lily a bigger role in the movie, more so than the “damsel in distress” that she was in the original, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;DisInsider</a>. “Tiger Lily is indigenous to Neverland with a bow at her back, she is both a fierce warrior and a serene and benevolent leader who protects Neverland and the lost boys and girls from the dastardly Captain Hook. This character will speak in both English and a native language,” a character breakdown said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>The&nbsp;<i>Peter Pan & Wendy</i> stars discussed their experience starring in the upcoming film at the D23 Expo in September 2022, according to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “It’s been really amazing to be able to play Wendy,” Ever said. “Wendy and Peter are equals in this film,” she added. Jude Law, who plays Captain Hook, said, “We got to mine their backstory a little more and try to know their past, when they were friends. It was nice to layer in that understanding of why Hook is so iconic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2Beq56qXaWur3nAp5tmr5Wjsbp5k29nb2xobXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-franceska-jaimes-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Franceska Jaimes Dating Now</a>
