He studied marketing at Quinnipiac University, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. He currently works as a Financial Services Professional for New York Life Securities.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While he may not be pursuing a career as a rapper, T’ziah has dabbled in the music industry. He was an A&R consultant for Roc Nation, and he was also a road manager and assistant to his dad. When Busta celebrated his 50th birthday, he also penned a sweet tribute to him on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Thanking the most high for allowing you to see 50. Last night was truly an amazing night and it was a pleasure to see you surrounded by love and to receive your flowers by close friends and family!” he wrote.</p><h2>Mariah Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Busta-Rhymes-kids-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Busta’s</a> eldest daughter is&nbsp;<strong>Mariah Smith,&nbsp;</strong>25.

Her social media says she studied finance at the University of Southern New Hampshire, and she currently works for CX company Concentrix.</p><h2>T’Khi Wood-Smith</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Busta welcomed his third child in 1999, when&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>T’Khi</a>,&nbsp;</strong>24, was born. T’Khi studied at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pace University</a>, where he also played on the football team as a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defensive back</a>. He graduated in May 2023, and his older brother wrote a beautiful message congratulating him on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “I am very proud of your accomplishments and I’m very proud of you! I love you more than I can put into words! To more accomplishments & blessings!” he wrote.</p><h2>Cacie Smith</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Busta’s second daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cacie</a>,&nbsp;</strong>24, has also dabbled in the entertainment industry, but she’s entered a very different part than her dad. She’s a model and social media influencer, and she often shares her amazing looks on her Instagram page. Her Insta bio also says that she’s currently residing in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Trillian Wood-Smith</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Like his older sister,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Trillian</a>,&nbsp;</strong>22, is also an influencer, and he’s shown that he has plenty of interest in a number of different fields. He hosts the podcast&nbsp;The Last Drink,&nbsp;puts on events with Breadwinners Entertainment, has a clothing brand Loner, and a non-profit To Build A Black Nation Foundation, according to his Instagram bio. His bio also says that his older brother T’ziah is his manager. He often shares glimpses of his lavish lifestyle on social media. He also indicated that he’s a student at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in some of his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posts</a>.</p><h2>Miracle Smith</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Busta’s third daughter <strong>Miracle Smith,&nbsp;</strong>17, was born in 2006.
