He is a university student studying criminology. Currently, he may be seen on the television reality program “Too Hot to Handle” looking for love. He stated basketball is his first passion and is having joy settling down.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Truth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Name</strong></td><td>Truth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>reality star and model</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>African-American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth City</strong></td><td>Texas</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Country</strong></td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong></td><td>straight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relation With</strong></td><td>Jazlyn Holloway, Izzy Fairthorne</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>193&nbsp;cm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Networth</strong></td><td>$100 k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>1998</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>He Reveals His Name</h2><p>Truth is not his given name. Robert Christian is his full name. All of his supporters burst out laughing as his identity was revealed on the television. It’s been stated that when he initially appeared on the program, many asked him whether Truth was his actual name.&nbsp;However, he informed them that that was not the case. In any case, his old name is fine, he said. Furthermore, Truth said that he would always say the 99.9% truth. That’s why he goes by that name. The crowd immediately rushed to the comment area and remarked, watching #toohottohandle, and the person noting the comment cackled as the man revealed his true identity as Robert. Another example is the guy referring to himself as Truth when he is really Robert, and so on.</p><h2>Is Truth still not ready for a meaningful relationship?</h2><p>He acknowledged during the introductory portion that he is still not ready to be in a meaningful relationship. He is, nonetheless, content with his solitary existence. In his words, he is having too much fun with so many different ladies to settle down right now.&nbsp;He is far from prepared. Later, he said that he will be ready in the next years, which may be in his thirties, forties, eighties, or anywhere in between. Nonetheless, he said that the lady loves him and that their sentiments are reciprocal.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Truth-3.jpg alt=Truth width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Truth seems to be a guy of few words.</h2><p>His TikTok is said to be a massive thirst trap. In his bio, he just mentions his height and where he resides, namely Houston. He has only seen uploading videos in which he is smoldering into the camera or lip-syncing.&nbsp;Nonetheless, his Instagram seems to be the same, with mirror photos and shirtless postures. In addition, the captions he writes are generally brief, consisting of an emoji or two to three sentences.</p><h2>Was he seeing two different females at the same time?</h2><p>During the days at Too Hot to Handle villa, Truth is considered to be a significant rule-breaker. He walked towards both females, Izzy, and Jazz, at that time. He kissed both ladies and expressed his desire to be with both of them. Regardless, the two females discovered what he was up to. Finally, he was fired for not strictly adhering to the guidelines.</p><h2>Siblings</h2><p>On October 6, 2021, he published a TikTok video in which he was caught addressing his sister. “My sister be hating,” the post said, with the hashtags fyp, family, nephew, and babysitting. That’s all we know about his family. It is thought that he is of mixed African-American and Hispanic ancestry. His family members that remark on Instagram are mostly his Hispanic relatives.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Truth-2.jpg alt=Truth width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>As of October 2023, his true net worth is yet to be exposed in the media. However, since he is a collegiate basketball star and a model, we believe he will be paid well. He would have received 200,000 dollars if he won the program. As a criminal science student, Robert Christian will earn a nice wage after his schooling is over and he starts his work in this profession. His net worth is believed to be $100,000, according to reports.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Model</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Reality star</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKddnby1edOoZKGZnpm5pnnSrZirZaSnwrW0jKyrmqyVmXq1tMCtZKGdXZ7AbrrOrWSynaRiv6atw7Jkraddl7Jutc1mmGarlae2sMHSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./are-poppy-and-branch-dating-trolls.html>&#171;&nbsp;Are Poppy and Branch Dating in Trolls?</a>
