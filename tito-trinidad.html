Trinidad.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the family moved to Cupey Alto, a subdivision of San Juan, Puerto Rico, when Tito was a child.</p><h3>It’s a father-son thing.</h3><p>Tito was born to be a boxer, no doubt about it. His indulgence in boxing from the early age of 12 shows his level of attachment with the sport.</p><p>Tito got it from his father. Felix Trinidad Sr. was a featherweight champion in the 1970s. He trained Tito and passed the love for boxing.</p><p>Moreover, Tito soon got into boxing after his father’s career ended.</p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Big Boss Man Bio: Personal life, Wrestling Career & Death >></a></strong></p><h2>Personal Life: Wife and Daughter&nbsp;</h2><p>As for his personal life, Tito Trinidad is a married man and tied to Sharon Santiago.
