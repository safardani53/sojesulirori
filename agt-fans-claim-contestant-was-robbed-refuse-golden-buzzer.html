shows without having to audition in anymore rounds in between then.</p><p>It goes to acts who truly blow the judges away and each <a href=#>judge</a>, along with <a href=#>Terry Crews</a>, gets one.</p><p>The Season 18 premiere aired on Tuesday, May 30, and the show already gave one away.</p><p>However, fans were torn on who should have gotten it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON AGT">READ MORE ON AGT</h2><p>D'Corey sang a beautiful rendition of Journey's Open Arms.</p><p>He captured the audience's attention with his stage presence and voice.</p><p>Many fans thought he should have gotten the Golden Buzzer of the night, but he didn't.</p><h2>BUZZ WORTHY</h2><p>D'Corey's audition was <a href=# aria-label="posted (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted </a>to <a href=#>Instagram</a>, which led many people to leave comments.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"He deserved the golden buzzer tbh," one fan wrote.</p><p>To that, another fan agreed: "Definitely!"</p><p>"Yes, he did," replied another.</p><p>"<a href=#>AGT </a>should have given him the Golden Buzzer," commented one fan.</p><p>A third added: "Should’ve gotten the golden buzzer he was so good."</p><p>"Our Kentucky boy deserved the Golden Buzzer. Shame on you @agt," said a furious fan.</p><p>"DC DESERVES THE GOLDEN BUZZER," an enthusiastic fan said.</p><p>"Where's the Golden Buzzer?" asked an Instagram user.</p><p>There were many other comments saying the same thing.</p><p>Although he did not get the Golden Buzzer from the judges, he did get four yeses and a standing ovation.</p><h2>'PEREFECT AUDITION'</h2><p>However, a Golden Buzzer was given out at the end of the show to Mzansi Youth Choir from&nbsp;<a href=#>South Africa</a>, and everyone was brought to tears.</p><p><a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, 63, asked how the group started, and a member explained that the founders created the choir to help change the lives of young people.</p><p>When the choir started to perform, their song choice shocked the judges.</p><p>They sang a song called It's Okay by the singer and songwriter <a href=#>Nightbirde</a>.</p><p>Nightbirde appeared on&nbsp;<a href=#>America's Got Talent</a>&nbsp;in 2021 for performing It's Okay at her audition - where she received a golden buzzer.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had to&nbsp;<a href=#>leave the competition</a>&nbsp;because she was struggling to win her battle with cancer.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>AGT legend passed away</a>&nbsp;in February 2022 at the age of 31.</p><p>As the choir began to sing, Simon and&nbsp;<a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a>, 50, looked at each other with pleasantly surprised expressions.</p><p><a href=#>Howie Mandel</a>, 67, looked thrilled to be hearing the song performed on the AGT stage once again, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Heidi Klum</a>, 49, immediately recognized the melody.</p><p>By the time it was over, host Terry, 54, was wiping away tears.</p><h2>LET'S HEAR FROM THE JUDGES</h2><p>Sofia said it was a "surprise to hear that song," and their voices were "fantastic."</p><p>&nbsp;She also told the group that they had the "perfect&nbsp;<a href=#>AGT</a>&nbsp;audition."</p><p>Howie added: "I'll always remember Nightbirde, and to see that it touched people on the other side of the globe - unbelievable."</p><p>When it was Simon's turn to speak to the group, he asked why they chose to perform It's Okay.</p><p>One of the group's leaders said: "When we heard Nightbirde sing the song on this stage, we were very inspired and touched by her story that we decided to record the song.</p><p>"To our surprise, she responded so beautifully. This song has been such a pillar of strength for us as a choir through difficult times.</p><p>"We just want to continue her legacy."</p><p>At this point, the audience had begun to chant&nbsp;<a href=#>"golden buzzer"</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href=#>the judges</a>.</p><p>After that answer, Simon couldn't continue. He stared down at his lap and started to breathe heavily while Sofia rubbed his shoulder.</p><p>He then said, "I know how much this would have...would have meant to her," and in the middle of that sentence, he started to cry.</p><p>Everyone, including the performers, had tears in their eyes, and the audience continued to chant "golden buzzer."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Simon then made a suggestion that would change AGT's history.</p><p>For the first time in AGT history, the audience was given the power of the&nbsp;<a href=#>golden buzzer</a>&nbsp;- and they decided to give it to the Mzansi Youth Choir.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/agts-furious-fans-claim-incredible-821762623.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/america-s-got-talent-judge-807376808-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/agts-furious-fans-claim-incredible-821762618.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYmp9dISQaJigrF2brq%2B%2FjJyjmqGdYrCwutOeqq2Znql6uK3SZqmompKasW6%2BxJ%2BsrJ1dnLytsMSnZJutqq%2Bys3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bill-fennelly.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fame | Bill Fennelly net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a>
