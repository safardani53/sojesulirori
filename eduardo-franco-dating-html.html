But the long-haired actor did not&nbsp;have the easiest of starts in Hollywood.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Franco had nothing but his talents&nbsp;and the love of his parents to push him forward, which was just what he needed to make it in the ruthless business that we call&nbsp;show. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Eduardo Franco’s Parents and Family</h2><p>Franco is Mexican-American. Although his exact birth date is still a matter of debate and mystery, he is in his late 20s.</p><p>He was born in Yuma, Arizona, to Mexican parents. He had family members across the border and he spent most of his early childhood traveling back and forth from Mexico.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As he grew older, however, the visits became few and far between. He talked about how things changed during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Remezcla</a> in 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Eduardo Franco in December 2019.</strong> (Photo: Eduardo Franco/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>"The thing is, going into Mexico is awesome. I mean, the food is fantastic and I got to hang out with my cousins. And going in is a breeze," he said. "But coming back into the US?&nbsp;You sometimes wait in line one or two hours."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>US customs made his life miserable while returning from across the border, and he eventually stopped going altogether.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Franco comes from a middle-class background and his family is a big part of his life. He grew up supporting his parents financially and they, too, have always been supportive of his career choices.&nbsp;</p><p>He moved to Los Angeles after spending formative years in Arizona. But&nbsp;his parents couldn't aid him financially. All they could give him was their ever-present emotional support, which he said made his achievements "far more rewarding." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Story behind His Amazing Hair</h2><p>Franco's luscious hair is one of, if not the most, recognizable feature. And it has its own story.</p><p>One of the relatives he used to visit during his trips to Mexico was his aunt. She ran a hair salon and used to cut his hair every time he went there.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, as his visits became scarce, so did the haircuts. So he just stopped waiting to get cuts and let his locks grow.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>From then to now, as Remezcla notes, he has only cut it once. That was at 16 when he wanted to get a job at a movie theater.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He wanted to save up for a car but just gave his savings to his parents to pay some bills instead.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Eduardo Franco Is in a Band</h2><p>Aside from acting, Franco also has serious musical talents. He is in a band, Dumb B*****s With Internet, with one <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other person</a> named Nixon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They put out a three-song album called The Most Album Ever on May 13, 2022, and they filled it <a href=# rel="follow noopener">with expletives</a>, to say the least. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Friends with Charlie Heaton</h2><p>Note: Spoilers Ahoy!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>There's a scene on Stranger Things season 4 where Franco's character, Argyle, and <a href=# rel=follow>Charlie Heaton</a>'s character, Jonathan Byers, play golf at a vacant lot in the middle of a desert. The scene looks incredibly simple at first glance.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, it was far from it. Neither Franco nor Heaton knew how to play golf.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So, the showmakers took both actors to a country club and had them learn golf for an entire day. The two developed a friendship during the outing and it translated to amazing on-screen chemistry.</p><h2>Who Is Eduardo Franco Dating?</h2><p>Nobody knows. He is yet to talk about having a girlfriend. But he might have hinted at having a boyfriend.</p><p>On June 13, 2018, Franco <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted a picture</a> with Daniel Doheny, showing a middle finger to the camera (something he apparently does a lot). "MY HOT [expletive] BOYFRIEND," he wrote in the caption. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Was he joking? Was he serious but trying to make it look not-so-serious? Your guess is as good as anyone's.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2Uqq6zsM5mnauZnpi8brDAraCnn16dwa64</p></div><div id=links><a href=./abira-greene.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fame | Abira Greene net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a>
