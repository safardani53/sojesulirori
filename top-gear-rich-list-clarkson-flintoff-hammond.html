The day after they met in 2000, he bought her a silver Ferrari - despite the fact she couldn't drive.</p><p>Chris also owned three pubs at one point, and has done well out of property.</p><p>In 2001 he sold his Chelsea home to the singer <a href=#>George Michael</a> for £7.5m - making a half a million pounds profit. In 2011 he made £5.5m on the sale of a Californian home, and a year later he sold his Surrey pad to a Russian tycoon, netting £4m profit.</p><p>Now the star, believed to be worth £95m, lives in Marlow in a five-bed pad he bought for £4m in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2>Matt LeBlanc - £66 million&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01-29-05-2016-242420736.jpg><p><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a> pocketed a fortune from Friends, reportedly earning him up to £800,000 per episode, and was later paid £2m for the special cast reunion in 2021.</p><p>Alongside his three year run on Top Gear until 2020, which earned him £1m a year, he starred in the sitcoms Episodes and Man With A Plan.</p><p>Matt, said to be worth £66m, owns a sprawling LA mansion for £5.6m but lives a very quiet life, insisting that unlike his Friends character Joey Tribbiani, he’s actually “shy”.</p><p>He also has an impressive car collection including a Mercedes, Ferrari and at least two Porsches.</p><h2>Jeremy Clarkson - £55.8m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/time-medicine-515275837.jpg><p>Yorkshire-born Jeremy, who is worth a reported £55.8m, started off as a motoring journalist for the Rotherham Advertiser before landing his big break on Top Gear.</p><p>He hosted the format for 10 years from 1988 and later as part of its revamped show in 2002 - eventually becoming the BBC’s highest-paid star with a £1.5m-a-year salary.</p><p>In 2012, Jeremy raked in a reported £5m from selling his half of Bedder 6, supposedly a play on ‘better sex’, which was a production company that held the rights to Top Gear.</p><p>The BBC parted ways with the presenter in 2015 amid an alleged fight with a producer.</p><p>Three years on, Jeremy bagged his Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? gig, earning him an estimated £3m a year.</p><p>But his biggest TV deal was a slice of £160m from Amazon Prime to produce 36 episodes of The Grand Tour. Clarkson reportedly earns £10m a year from the show.</p><p>In 2021, Jeremy started an unusual side-project - running his own farm, which he turned into the TV series Clarkson’s Farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s estimated the site, where he also brews his own beer, was bought by Clarkson for £6m and is currently worth a whopping £12.5m.&nbsp;</p><p>Away from TV gigs, Jeremy is rumoured to be paid £25k for giving after-dinner speeches and tops up his earnings writing books and newspaper columns.</p><p>Like any fast car fanatic, Clarkson has a drool-worthy collection of vehicles that are reportedly worth over £500K, including a Ferrari, Mercedes, Lamborghini and McLaren.</p><h2>Richard Hammond&nbsp; - £35m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/daredevil-tv-presenter-richard-hammond-4349107.jpg><p><a href=#>Richard Hammond</a> received a massive pay bump after moving from Top Gear to The Grand Tour where his annual earnings rose from £500,000 to a reported £7.2m.</p><p>He also made money presenting Brainiac: Science Abuse from 2003 to 2006, Total Wipeout from 2009 to 2012, and Planet Earth Live in 2012.</p><p>Richard, known as ‘The Hamster’ on the show, has an impressive car collection including a Ford Mustang, Porsche, Lotus Esprit Sport and a 1931 Lagona, as well as a Bentley.</p><p>In 2009 he treated himself to a £150K helicopter that he used to commute to and from his £2.5m Herefordshire home, Bollitree Castle.</p><p>He purchased the grade II listed building - which has six bedrooms, a swimming pool and 20 acres of land - with wife Mindy in 2008.</p><h2>James May - £31m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taken-without-permission-inside-top-745183022.jpg><p>He was branded ‘Captain Slow’ on Top Gear - but we’re sure <a href=#>James May</a> was laughing all the way to the bank after netting a smooth £31m.</p><p>James reportedly made £500,000 a year from his 12-year stint on Top Gear, which ended in 2015 and has since been topped up thanks to The Grand Tour and a clever business deal.</p><p>James, Jeremy and Richard co-founded production company W Chump & Sons Ltd, which owns the rights to the show - much like Clarkson did with Bedder 6.&nbsp;</p><p>The trio reportedly make £18,783 per day from The Grand Tour and James is believed to be on £7.2m per year - roughly £600,000 per episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Jeremy, the TV star owns an impressive array of cars including a Ferrari, Tesla, BMW, Rolls Royce and a Bentley - as well as a VW Beach Buggy used in the Amazon Prime show.</p><p>James, who has a £5m home in Hammersmith and another property in Wiltshire, tops up his earnings by writing and fronting TV shows about cars, food and travel.</p><h2>Freddie Flintoff - £14.5m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/12-9-19-top-gear-521376719.jpg><p>Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff made a fortune from his cricket career as one of the best international all-rounders.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s since used his cheeky personality to bag TV gigs including A League Of Their Own and Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams.
