affair to his wife.</p><p>Clare fell for the handsome love rat after he convinced her that his <a href=#>marriage</a> was over.</p><p>She said: “I never thought that I would become a mistress — I hate the idea of taking another woman’s husband.</p><p>“I was effectively conned into becoming the lover of a married man.</p><p>“I believe men <a href=#>cheat</a> because they reach a stage where they

STRAYING</h3></p><p><strong>1. LATE NIGHTS</strong></p><p>A big pointer is if your partner is staying up well after you have gone to bed.</p><p>It’s easy to FaceTime or Skype a lover in the early hours, while the family is safely asleep in bed.</p><p><strong>2. MYSTERY SPENDING</strong></p><p>If your other half has taken out a new credit card without mentioning it to you, this is a red flag.</p><p>Look out for the bills arriving which are immediately spirited away.</p><p>Or if you see new plastic appear in his wallet keep your wits about you – it may have an online statement you can’t see.</p><p>Likewise, another big clue is mysterious big-money purchases appearing on bank statements.</p><p>If he wasn’t with you splashing the cash, the question is: who was he with?</p><p><strong>3. CHANGING TASTES</strong></p><p>If your beau is suddenly interested in new music and downloading tunes from bands he had never heard of before, be alert.</p><p>This influence may be coming from someone whose opinion he values, and who he is desperate to impress.</p><p><strong>4. TECH SECRECY</strong></p><p>If your other half hides their phone or laptop from you, or locks it with a new code this may be cause for concern.</p><p><strong>5. SARCASM</strong></p><p>I learned from overhearing calls that when a person is lying they have very little time to make up a story.</p><p>Sarcasm is one way to bluster through explanations. Wise-crack answers may mean you are being lied to.</p><p><strong>6. MORE TIME BEING SPENT WITH FEMALE CO-WORKER</strong></p><p>Spending more time than usual with a woman from work, chatting to her online or arranging work trips in which she is always a part, is a red flag.</p><p>This is how my lover covered up many of his liaisons with me.</p><p><strong>7. NEW MANNERISMS</strong></p><p>Using new phrases, trendy slang or mannerisms is a big clue.</p><p>If they’re spending time with a younger woman they’ll subconsciously pick up many on-trend expressions they never used before.</p><p><strong>8. BECOMING A PEACOCK</strong></p><p>Taking more pride in their appearance, buying new clothes, dieting or becoming very keen on visiting the gym is a classic sign of philandering.</p><p>They thought they were good enough for you before, so why are they having doubts now?</p><p>Could there be someone want to impress?</p><p><strong>9. SEX LIFE LOSING ITS SPARKLE</strong></p><p>Most men, no matter how duplicitous, find it hard to sleep with two women at the same time.</p><p>It takes an awful lot of energy and planning so your love life will suffer if you are living with a cheat.</p><p><strong>10. EMOTIONAL DISTANCE</strong></p><p>If his eye is wandering your partner may stop letting you in on their plans, or being evasive about things like booking holidays or days out.</p><p>“It’s a cliche, but it’s often part of a mid-life crisis — they think they will regain their youth by bedding a younger woman.</p><p>“I think married men often search for women who seem vulnerable, because this makes them more susceptible to their charm.</p><p>“Often they are going through a period of stress or even depression, and feel they need to bring excitement into their life.”</p><p>He spent £3,000 on me on just one night out</p><p>She continued: “I have made a promise to myself, I will never be a mistress again, as my relationship with a married man ended very badly and left me both depressed and ill, with my self-confidence shattered.</p><p>“I’m just glad I can help other women spot the warning signs.”</p><p>The online PA, who lives in New Cross, South East London, first met Jeremy (not his real name) when he hired her to work for him.</p><p>Clare said: “We met in October 2013.</p><p>“He contacted me over email to say he wanted to hire me as an online PA for a music management business.</p><p>“There was a picture of me on my agency profile and I now suspect that was what attracted him.</p><p>“At the time I was lonely and vulnerable, having just come out of a relationship.</p><p>“He was 35, very confident and seemed successful.</p><p>“He sent me work but we became more chatty.</p><p>“After a couple of months he suggested we meet, and said he would come and see me in Newcastle where I was living at the time from his home in North London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000260363219.jpg><p>“I was shocked to hear he was married, with two young children who were three and five at the time, as he was so flirtatious.</p><p>“But he said he was in the process of separating.</p><p>“He and his wife didn’t have <a href=#>sex</a>.</p><p>“I believed him — I was really falling for him.</p><p>“When he arrived at my home he was chatty, flattering, bearing gifts and whisked me out for an expensive meal.</p><p>“We slept together almost straight away.</p><p>“He stayed with me for almost two weeks — I later found out he’d told his wife he was on a business trip.</p><p>“He bought me presents such as beautiful shoes and a handbag, using a credit card I found out he’d taken out after he hired me.</p><p>“He spent £3,000 on me in one night when we went to an expensive lap-dancing club which I hated.</p><p>“But I was being swept off my feet, and I fell in love with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000260313592.jpg> <img

suspect he was not actually in the process of getting separated when he forbade me from calling him on his mobile.</p><p>“We only talked via Skype late at night.</p><p>“I began to realise I was now in the role of ‘mistress’ but persuaded myself I wasn’t hurting anyone, as she didn’t know about me.</p><p>“I thought mistresses were women who sat about filing their nails, not go-ahead intelligent women like me.</p><p>“I’d never thought of myself as a mistress but there I was, effectively a kept woman.</p><p>“We talked to each other for several hours three or four nights a week, always in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>“He came up to see me often, faking business trips.</p><p>“We started to make plans for him leaving his wife and moving in with me.</p><p>“I lived for his visits and our talks late into the night.”</p><p>I realised I was only there for one thing – sex</p><p>But Clare’s affair came crashing down a year after it began.</p><p>She recalled: “I got a phone call from his wife.</p><p>“She asked if I was Clare — I knew who it was straight away.</p><p>“She shouted, ‘Stay away from my husband,’ and ranted about me being a home-wrecker until I ended the call shaking and crying.</p><p>“I felt as if a disaster was looming, but still I didn’t leave him.</p><p>“As the weeks went on and he didn’t leave her I realised the truth, I was only there for one thing — sex.</p><p>“He didn’t care about me, he just wanted a fling.</p><p>“I’d been an idiot.</p><p>“I was ill, exhausted by the situation and the lies, and after one terrible row he left me high and dry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000260363616.jpg><p>“Emotionally he had taken everything and given me nothing.”</p><p>Clare vowed: “I’ll never be the ‘other woman’ again.</p><p>“You’d have to have a heart of stone to cope with the despair, the false promises and lies.</p><p>“You’re just a prize to them, a symbol of their mid-life crisis like a fast car.</p><p>“It put me off men and dating for over a year, and I am only just dipping my toe in the water again — and isn’t going to be with a married man.</p><p>“As someone that knows, I have a list of tips so women in relationships can look at to see if their man is cheating.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>“At least helping others spot a
