She recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up to PEOPLE</a> about the start of their relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I knew we had a very strong unstoppable connection from the first week of writing and working together in the studio.
