they're still the proud parents of six children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2002, Jolie became a mom for the first time when she adopted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Maddox Chivan</a>, 22, from an orphanage in Cambodia. Three years later, the family grew with the addition of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Zahara Marley</a>, 19, who was born in Ethiopia. It wasn't long before Pitt also adopted Jolie's first two children — and the couple decided to further expand their family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the 2006 birth of their daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Shiloh Nouvel</a>, 17, Jolie and Pitt adopted their son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Pax Thien</a>, 20, from Vietnam. Then in 2008, their household grew even more when they welcomed their twins <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Knox Léon</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Vivienne Marcheline</a>, 15.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jolie has said that having a large family and a multicultural upbringing has impacted her children in an overwhelmingly positive way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They're pretty great people and because there's so many of them, I think they've had a very significant effect on each other. It's not like I'm the head of anything. I'm very honest with my kids. And I'm very human with my kids," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jolie told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the 2020 Oscars, Pitt opened up about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wanting his children to follow their own interests</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Listen, I want them to follow their bliss, follow their passions, whatever they're most interested in," he said in the press room. "It's about guiding as you can."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, Jolie told Vogue that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her children "saved" her</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was 26 when I became a mother,” she said. “My entire life changed. Having children saved me — and taught me to be in this world differently. I think, recently, I would’ve gone under in a much darker way had I not wanted to live for them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jolie later joked to WSJ. Magazine that she doesn't "really have ... a social life," as she prefers to spend her time with her kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They are the closest people to me and my life, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>they’re my close friends</a>," she told the outlet. "We’re seven very different people, which is our strength."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Angelina Jolie</a>'s children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-maddox-chivan-jolie-pitt-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt</strong>, 22</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christopher Jue/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jolie and Pitt's oldest child, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt, was born on August 5, 2001 in Battambang, Cambodia. After spending the first seven months of his life in an orphanage, he was adopted by Jolie, who had previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fallen in love with the country</a> while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider the year prior. Jolie visited only one orphanage and felt an instant connection with Maddox, explaining that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>when she saw him</a> lying in a box suspended from the ceiling, she "cried and cried."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time of Maddox's adoption, Jolie was still married to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Billy Bob Thornton</a> — although she adopted the little boy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>on her own</a>. Several months after returning home with Maddox, Jolie and Thornton called it quits, and she began to raise the little boy as a single parent. In 2005, Jolie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>started dating</a> Pitt and by the end of that year, Pitt had begun the process to also adopt Maddox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the time he was 6, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jolie shared</a> that Maddox was growing up into a "little intelligent man," adding that he was "so smart and so witty." She even called the little boy her "best buddy" and "the coolest little person" she'd ever met.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Maddox grew older, he became increasingly interested in both Jolie's humanitarian work and her work as a filmmaker. At age 15, he worked as an executive producer on Jolie's film First They Killed My Father, the film adaptation of her friend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Loung Ung</a>'s book about the Cambodian genocide by the Khmer Rouge regime. Jolie later explained that she, in part, took on the film because she hoped Maddox would learn "about who he is" and become "that much more connected to his country."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Han Myung-Gu/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He goes back and forth [to Cambodia] a lot, but this would be over four months of just being in the country, really reading, listening, learning and absorbing all things about his culture and country [including] the very, very dark parts," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, Maddox enrolled in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>South Korea's Yonsei University</a>, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jolie said</a> she "could not be happier about." While he was forced to take classes remotely during the pandemic, he was eventually able to return to campus where he is studying biochemistry and working on learning the Korean language.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm so happy for [Maddox] that he's grown up into such a good man. I say that 'cause he's smart and he's doing his work, but he's also wild. He's balanced in his teenage years," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jolie shared</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2023, Jolie and Maddox <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>attended a state dinner at the White House</a>, where President <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Joe Biden</a> and First Lady <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jill Biden</a> hosted South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and First Lady Kim Keon Hee.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anna Moneymaker/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Asia-America relations are important to Angelina's family.

Jolie initially visited Zahara's orphanage with Maddox after he had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>taken an interest</a> in traveling to Africa. Upon meeting the little girl, Maddox noticed that she "needed care." "Kids understand sadness and poverty and hunger," Jolie said at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When they later returned to make the adoption official, Jolie was also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>joined by Pitt</a>. In July 2005, they returned home, where Zahara was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>treated for a salmonella infection</a> at a New York City hospital and made a full recovery — ready to begin life with her family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Mad loves her. When Z came home she was older, she was seven months old, so for Mad it's like having this tiny pet he can just hold and look at. He's great," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jolie said at the time</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, Zahara has gotten the opportunity to travel around the world with her family, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>visiting her home country of Ethiopia</a> for a special trip in 2019. During the visit, Jolie and Zahara met with the country's first female president, Sahle-Work Zewde, where they discussed Ethiopian culture and history as well as issues like education and treating drug-resistant tuberculosis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, Zahara launched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her Zahara Collection jewelry line</a> in collaboration with jeweler Robert Procop. All proceeds from the collection benefited House of Ruth Shelters, a Los Angeles-based organization which provides transitional housing for battered women and children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Jolie revealed that Zahara had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>undergone several surgeries</a> although she did not specify the reasoning. The teen was able to recover at home during the pandemic, when her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>schooling transitioned online</a>. During that time, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jolie opened up</a> about raising Zahara, praising her as "an extraordinary African woman."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My daughter is from Ethiopia, one of my children … And I have learned so much from her. She is my family, but she is an extraordinary African woman and her connection to her country, her continent, is her own and it's something I only stand back in awe of," Jolie shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, Jolie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dropped Zahara off at Spelman college</a>. The mother and daughter met with school president Dr. Helene Gayle and Vice President for Student Affairs Darryl Holloman, who shared a photo and video from the event <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>on Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked how she felt about being a Spelman mom, Jolie replied, "I'm gonna start crying! I have not started crying yet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zahara <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority</a> at Spelman in November 2023.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Professor Jane Stoever, University of CA Irvine School of Law</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to being a college student, the teen has been busy helping with her mother's humanitarian efforts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jolie and Zahara traveled to Washington, D.C.</a> to meet with lawmakers to advocate for the passage of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2022, which aims to protect crime victims by creating a victims' right to evidence and agency reports, improve forensic science, end the rape kit backlog and address racial disparities in wrongful convictions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In photos from the visit, Jolie and Zahara can be seen meeting with Patrick Leahy, one of the bill's sponsors, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, the mother-daughter duo <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>took another trip together</a> — this time to New York City. Jolie and Zahara were spotted walking hand in hand through John F.

Their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>daughter Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt was born</a> on May 27 at Cottage Hospital in Swakopmund, Namibia, where the family had spent the past few months. Shiloh immediately fit in with her family, and one year after her birth, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jolie said</a> the little girl was reminding her a lot of herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Shi's so full of light and love, she's just a little honey, and very, very funny. I think I'm recognizing some of myself in that one — she's going to be a little bit of trouble!" she shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jolie has said that growing up, Shiloh thought she was "one of the brothers," and the family has always supported her fashion choices. The actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told Reuters</a> in 2010, "I think she is fascinating, the choices she is making. And I would never be the kind of parent to force somebody to be something they are not. I think that is just bad parenting. Children should be allowed to express themselves in whatever way they wish without anybody judging them because it is an important part of their growth. Society always has something to learn when it comes to the way we judge each other, label each other. We have far to go."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Shiloh has gotten older, she's become increasingly involved in her mother's humanitarian efforts. At just nine years old, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>requested to join her mother</a> on a trip where they traveled to the Middle East for World Refugee Day — and they have now traveled all across the globe together. Since then, Shiloh has also accompanied Jolie on numerous red carpets, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>including several humanitarian events</a>. As the duo share an especially tight-knit relationship, she even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>encouraged Jolie</a> to take on her role in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>The One and Only Ivan</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now at 16, Shiloh spends much of her spare time dancing, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>practicing at Millennium Dance Complex</a>, an elite dance studio in L.A.

He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was adopted by Jolie</a> in 2007 at age three when she traveled to the country with Maddox. At the time, Jolie adopted the little boy solo as Vietnamese law makes it difficult for unmarried couples to adopt, but he was formally adopted by Pitt in 2008.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after bringing Pax home, Jolie shared that the little boy was spending time getting accustomed to his surroundings and enjoying his new sense of freedom, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>calling him</a> a "tough, remarkable little person."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He spent 3 1/2 years of his life in one place, in one room, in this one little iron bed with 20 other kids, and having no choice for himself to do things, having no freedom. And suddenly, here he is in a very free situation with new brothers and sisters and a mom and dad. He's learning English and he's so loving and he's wild and free 'cause he suddenly has freedom so he's a little wild and crazy," Jolie shared.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>JC Olivera/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the years following his adoption, Jolie shared that Pax <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>formed a close bond</a> with Maddox and was enjoying life with his big family. In 2011, the group returned to Vietnam to explore Pax's home country ahead of his eighth birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Pax keeps much of his personal life out of the spotlight, he did make a small appearance in Jolie's 2016 film Kung Fu Panda 3, voicing the character Yoo. He also assisted Jolie and Maddox on First They Killed My Father, where he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>served as a set photographer</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, Jolie opened up to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE</a> about working with both Pax and Maddox on Without Blood, an upcoming film she directed. The two young men worked on the Italian set in the assistant director department, which serves as a liaison between the film's director and other departments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We work well together," Jolie said of her boys.
