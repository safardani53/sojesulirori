as she visited him at his charity foundation.</p><p>Former world heavyweight champ Bruno, 62, quizzed <a href=#>Tory</a> MP Maria Caulfied over government efforts to help people suffering with mental ill health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

– Bruno said: “This lady is on point. I am very impressed that she has come here and that she has listened.”</p><p>As gentle giant Bruno – who stands 6ft 3ins - taught her some pad-work Ms Caulfield joked: “You are taking it easy on me, aren’t you?”</p><p>Bruno - who has bipolar disorder and has spoken openly about his struggles since he hung up his gloves – revealed it was the first time a government minister had met him to discuss the issue in 20 years of mental health campaigning.</p><p>Mental Health Minister Ms Caulfield visited his Frank Bruno Foundation after the star blasted the government over its failure to include a mental health bill in <a href=#>the King’s Speech last month</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MENTAL HEALTH">READ MORE ON MENTAL HEALTH</h2><p>But – speaking after the pair met yesterday – Bruno told The Sun: “I am honoured that the Frank Bruno Foundation received a visit from Maria Caulfield.</p><p>“This lady is the first politician to have come to see us to see what we are doing.</p><p>“She knows what she is talking about and hopefully will make a difference.</p><p>“We are providing a unique service to the <a href=#>mental health community</a> and it is having a really positive impact.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>“The minister was really interested in our work and I was keen to hear how the government is looking to improve the future of mental health care.</p><p>“I was delighted the minister got into the boxing ring with me and pledged to continue the fight against mental health challenges.</p><p>“If there was somewhere like this foundation available when I was ill it could have really helped, so we need to see more services like this made available.”</p><p>Ms Caulfield’s visit came after the government last month announced £795 million of extra funding to support people with <a href=#>mental health</a> problems over the next five years.</p><p>It was planned so she could learn lessons from the foundation’s mixture of exercise and counselling to help people with mental ill health.</p><p>She said: “We, as a government, want to put mental health on a par with physical health.</p><p>“If someone is struggling with a long-term physical issue, they get treatment – and we want the same for mental health.</p><p>“It is great the way the foundation helps people who are not comfortable at other agencies – and may have fallen out of the system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000001075715.jpg><p>“They are plugging a gap that is sometimes there and we can learn a lot from the foundation – especially the way they include exercise as a way of helping people with their mental health.</p><p>“I would like to say a big thank you to <a href=#>Frank Bruno</a> for meeting me and sharing his experience with me.</p><p>“Frank and his team are doing a great job at getting people fighting fit through boxing classes, using innovative techniques to support local people with their mental health and wellbeing.</p><p>“This government is determined to help as many people as possible stay healthy, get off benefits, and move into work.</p><p>“That’s why we’ve just unveiled £795 million of new funding to provide more mental health treatments nationwide and help those with mental health conditions stay in or find work.”</p><p>Last month, Bruno hit out at the government on <a href=#>X/Twitter</a> for not including a mental health bill in the King’s Speech.</p><p>He added: “Constantly over the years I have been told by people within politics, ‘Yes we need to do something, yes there needs to be changes’.</p><p>“I wish each one of the decision-makers could spend a weekend with someone who has mental health issues…….and also spend a day and night in a secure unit.”</p><p>Ms Caulfield responded to the message – and arranged a visit to the foundation.</p><p>She explained: “I follow Frank online, because I am a Frank Bruno fan.<br>“I saw what he had to say and got in touch.</p><p>“It is impressive that they offer people a different way to get help and we are keen to learn lessons from it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000620745266.jpg><p>The Frank Bruno Foundation – in <a href=#>Northampton</a> – offers people help through referrals, with clients aged from 10 to those in their 70s.</p><p>They undergo an eight-week course, which includes non-contact boxing sessions.</p><p>And mental health nurses and counsellors are on hand to help people with their problems – and to get back into work.</p><p>After their course, people are able to come back into the centre and chat to staff and friends in a welcoming environment.</p><p>Mum of one Jo Messenger, 41, of Northampton – who has bipolar disorder – said: “This place is like a <a href=#>family</a> and has really helped me.</p><p>“I came to the foundation because I suffer from bipolar and coming here has really helped with my confidence and self-esteem.</p><p>“I have used the coping mechanisms I have learned here to help me in my life.”</p><p>And Deni Rovegno, 20, first came to the foundation in May 2021 – and is now a full-time member of staff who works as a Mental Health Development Officer.</p><p>Deni, of Northampton – who suffered crippling <a href=#>anxiety attacks</a> and struggled to leave his home – said: “I was really lucky to come here and enrol in programmes – and I now love helping other people.</p><p>“This is a safe place that tests your boundaries but where you also feel comfortable.”</p><p>Bruno opened the centre – which relies on fund-raising, donations and grants - in 2017.</p><p>More than 600 people have completed its courses since May 2021, when it got up and running after <a href=#>Covid</a>.</p><p>In an exclusive Sun interview in September 2021, Bruno bravely revealed he was sectioned during <a href=#>lockdown</a>.</p><p>It was the fifth time he had been sectioned under the mental health act.</p><p>The retired boxing champ told how he spent six weeks locked up in an NHS hospital after family and friends grew fearful for his safety.</p><p>And Bruno - who suffers from bipolar disorder – admitted: “I hit rock bottom.”</p><p>He was admitted to hospital after becoming thin and gaunt through excessive training at his home gym, which he carried out in a bid to keep his demons at bay.</p><p>Bruno – who won the World Title in 1995, beating Oliver McCall at Wembley – has fought a long battle with mental health problems.</p><p>He retired in 1996 after losing to <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a> - bringing an end to a glittering career which saw him win 40 out of his 45 fights.</p><p>He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1998 and was sectioned for the first time in 2003.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title
