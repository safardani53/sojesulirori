Religion &amp;amp; Origin</h1><div id=sub-header>April 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>People are curious about <strong>Harry Maguire’s Religion</strong> because he is an English professional footballer who plays center-back for the England national team. Maguire came up through Sheffield United’s youth system before breaking into the senior squad in 2011.&nbsp;He appeared in the club’s league 166 times and was voted Player of the Year three times in a row. He was also named to the PFA League One Team of the Year on many occasions.</p><p>Hull City paid £2.5 million for him in 2014. Hull City then loaned him to Wigan Athletic in 2015. He joined Leicester City in 2017 and received a $12 million signing bonus.&nbsp;A record-breaking £80 million was purportedly paid for him to transfer to Manchester United two years later, and he was chosen team captain after six months.&nbsp;Maguire appeared in one game for England’s under-21 squad in 2012. In October 2017, he made his senior debut. He was named to the England squads for the FIFA World Cups in 2018 and 2022, as well as the UEFA Euro 2020 when he was named to the tournament’s Team of the Tournament. Maguire was upgraded to the first-team squad and made his debut after being inserted as a halftime replacement and won the game’s man of the match award during a home game against Cardiff City in April 2011.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Harry-Maguire.jpg alt="Harry Maguire" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Harry Maguire Religion: Does He Practice Christianity? Ethnicity And Origin Of The Family</h2><p>No, Harry Maguire’s Religion is not Christian, contrary to popular belief. Harry Maguire’s religion is Roman Catholic, according to numerous sources. Maguire was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and reared in the nearby hamlet of Mosborough.&nbsp;His brothers, Joe and Laurence, are also football players. He attended Chesterfield’s St. Mary’s Roman Catholic High School and Spinkhill’s Immaculate Conception Catholic Primary School.</p><p>Unfortunately, as at the time this article was published, the athlete had not made many racial confessions to his fans. Maguire proposed to his longtime love Fern Hawkins in February 2018 after seven years of dating.&nbsp;On June 25, 2022, the couple exchanged vows at the Chateau de Varennes in South Burgundy, France.On April 3, Maguire revealed on his Instagram page that Hawkins had given birth to their first child, a girl. Maguire and Hawkins are expecting their second child on May 9, 2020. Similarly, he hasn’t spoken much about his family, therefore no reliable information about them could be found.</p><h2>Harry Maguire’s Net Worth</h2><p>Harry seems to be a bit guarded about his personal details, such as his net worth, since the sportsman has not revealed anything about it.&nbsp;According to several estimates, Harry’s net worth is predicted to be $20 million as of 2023. This information, however, has yet to be verified by Harry.&nbsp;Maguire is one of the highest-paid defenders in the Premier League, earning $190,000 a month.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Harry-Maguire-1.jpg alt="Harry Maguire" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Maguire’s market worth has dropped from $80 million to about $24-$43 million as a result of his unpredictable performances. Harry Maguire has a long-term deal with Puma, which increases his earning potential.&nbsp;Despite his fortune, the sportsman prefers not to flaunt it, as seen by the fact that he has not uploaded a single photo of himself with money.&nbsp;He goes by the Instagram name @harrymaguire93 and has over 4 million followers. He seems to be highly active there, as the athlete’s profile is kept up to date.&nbsp;Harry routinely publishes images there, with over 1k posts in which he shares pictures of himself on the field, with his teammates, on vacation, and many more.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqqirnqurcauoKudXZuurrXLsmSwoJGpwG60yKxknqyYo7aktdOyZKudnJ60qrvNZqaroZeeu3A%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./itv-blacklists-x-rated-only-fans-stars-reality-shows.html>&#171;&nbsp;ITV 'blacklists' X-rated Only Fans stars from appearing on its reality shows</a>
