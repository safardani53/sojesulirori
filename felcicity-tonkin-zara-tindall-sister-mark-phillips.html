But I have never been able to tell her.</p><p>"My ambition is to get Mark's public acceptance of her and to be able to enter his name on her birth certificate."</p><p>Unfortunately, her father's rejection has left Felicity heartbroken who learned the truth about him when she was eight.</p><p>During her time at school, she had to complete a school family tree project which led her to trying to learn as much as possible about her <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p>The Daily Express reported she kept a book about Mark by her bed, devouring articles about her British family.</p><p>New Idea reported Heather's ex-boyfriend Jason Fowell stated: “She’d have liked a card or something, some sort of recognition.</p><p>“She wished she had a father to go to school interviews, that sort of thing.</p><p>"I saw her cry about it.”</p><p>However, a <a href=#>palace</a> source stated "the story heaped shame on the royal family".</p><p>Despite having a younger half-sister, <a href=#>Zara</a> and her brother <a href=#>Peter</a> have had no contact with Felicity.</p><p>The palace source revealed: “They just don’t want to get involved and that’s probably the way it will stay.”</p><p>In 1999, Mark was asked if he planned to visit his daughter while they both attended the same equestrian event in <a href=#>New Zealand</a>.</p><p>He simply replied, “wrong subject”.</p><p>Despite being separated at the time the bombshell scandal was revealed, it prompted <a href=#>Princess Anne</a> to begin <a href=#>divorce proceedings</a> which were finalised in 1992.</p><p>Mark later married dressage rider Sandy Pflueger in 1997 and the couple had daughter <a href=#>Stephanie</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>They later divorced after it was reported Mark had left her for Lauren Hough, who was 32 years his junior.</p><p>In 2022, Mark was spotted at Burghley Horse Trials with rumoured new girlfriend Florence Standaert.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570aiwmqSjZIZ0gZhyanBnlpq5pLXCoquyZaSku6y1zWaxmqqRYsGqusOao6Vlo57AtbHRZqSaqptivam1y6Wgqatf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./boy-killed-hit-car-horror-crawley-crash.html>&#171;&nbsp;Boy pedestrian, 12, killed after being hit by a car in horror Crawley crash as cops appeal for witne</a>
