He was raised in the city of California,, and that’s where his Family’s hometown is.</p><p>His educational background is not known much. But we did some research and found out that he went to a local high school in California.</p><p>He passed out of high school around the age of 17-18 which is the average age of passing out from high school.</p><p>He was a pretty good student in his school. He was active in all academic and extracurricular activities of his school. He passed out of high school with pretty decent grades.</p><p>But it’s sure that his parents raised him with utter care and love. They must have taken care of all his needs throughout his childhood, ensuring that he stayed happy.</p><p>He had hobbies of drawing and writing in his childhood. His hobby of drawing must have helped him write the script for his vlogs today.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Pallo_Age></span>Kyle Pallo Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kyle Pallo is currently <strong>29 years old</strong> as of 2023 because he was born on March 18, 1994.</p><p>At this age, he’s been making fun and exciting videos on YouTube for quite a few years, taking his viewers along on various adventures and activities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Pallo_Career></span><strong>Kyle Pallo Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kyle-pallo-images.jpg><p>Kyle started his career as YouTuber and vlogger. He made his channel in September of 2014.</p><p>His first video is about him showing his Halloween Backyard Decorations. He must have uploaded videos casually at the beginning. But slowly he got steady growth and he improved his vlogging quality with time.</p><p>He started uploading seriously around 2018-19 when he reached around 20k subscribers on Youtube.&nbsp; As of now, he stands around 160k subscribers on his YouTube channel.</p><p>He also has an Instagram account with 65k followers and he describes himself as a theme park vlogger.

He started his relationship early this year.</p><p>Kyle had an ex-girlfriend named laura whom he broke up with last year. She made an Instagram post declaring their split around early 2020.</p><p>From Disney vlogs, a commenter said ‘’</p><p>Anyone here watches Kyle Pallo? I noticed he and his (former) friend Laura are no longer speaking, and Laura posted something on Instagram about it.</p><p>I’m just curious if anyone knows anything! I know Kyle has a new girlfriend (or someone who looks like one), and his and Laura’s relationship has always seemed a little more than just friends…’’</p><p>And one commenter replied</p><p>“Yeah… I keep an eye on him from time to time. I could go on and on about how much I dislike him…but what happened to Lora? I really like her:) Her Instagram is set to private, so I can’t see anything she posts.</p><p>If I had to guess, he was probably taking advantage of her and her kindness because she did contribute significantly to the growth of his channel.</p><p>But I can’t prove it. It would make sense because he does come across as a privileged, entitled man-child on occasion. What exactly did she say in her post?</p><p>His new girl is very attractive, and I like her as well. They are clearly dating, so Lora may have gotten the cold shoulder once.”</p><p>This pretty much speaks everything about his relationship status.</p><p>Other than that, much is not known about his personal life as he likes to keep it private. His hobbies include traveling and video making.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jacob Rott Tik Tok Star Biography</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Pallo_Net_Worth></span><strong>Kyle Pallo Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kyle Pallo net worth stands at around <strong>$1.5 million</strong> USD as of 2023.
